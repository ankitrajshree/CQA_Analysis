The difference between the reference here and that answer is this citation seems to be implying that there is a feed-forward structure in a *single column* in neocortex (since that's the picture represented here). This is certainly false, though works as a model sometimes. Although there is evidence for some feed-forward processing in a column, there is also a ton of recurrence and feedback. The feed-forward structure makes more sense between cortical areas (this is what the answer below addresses)." CreationDate="2017-08-03T01:58:51.927" UserId="8833" />

They may have good reasoning or no reasoning about it. It'd be useful if the down-votes reasoning are also audited in similar manner edits are audited. There should be some logic behind why such a downvote was casted. This will help newbies engage in this forum in smarter manner.
