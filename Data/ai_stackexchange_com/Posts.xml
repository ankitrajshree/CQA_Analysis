An imperative program describes &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do stuff, that is, algorithms. It specifies the specific instructions that the machine must carry on in order to perform the computation. OTOH, purely functional languages describe &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is to be computed, that is, the relationship between the input and the output. In mathematics, &quot;function&quot; is just a fancy name for a relationship between an input and an output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, in the mathematical sense, the only variability is that of the function's arguments. That is, the function's output depends solely on its input (arguments). This is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;referential transparency&lt;/a&gt;.

For the typical imperative language's definition of &quot;function&quot;, the above doesn't hold. For instance, C's &lt;code&gt;getchar()&lt;/code&gt; does not always return the same value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's say we want to calculate the set of the ten least prime numbers whose least significant digit is 3.

In mathematics, you don't worry about how is the set &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; supposed to be computed, but rather about &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;'s definition itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, in Python (in imperative style):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def is_prime(n):&#xA;  for x in range(2, n):&#xA;    if n % x == 0:&#xA;      return False&#xA;&#xA;  return True&#xA;&#xA;def foo():&#xA;  s = set()&#xA;  n = 2&#xA;  while len(s) &amp;lt; 10:&#xA;    if is_prime(n) and n % 10 == 3:&#xA;       s.append(n)&#xA;&#xA;  return set(s)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Python, we care about (and are responsible for) the algorithm being used to compute the set. We specify, pretty much in recipe-style, how to build the set from scratch. If there's an algorithm that may be better suited for checking whether a number is prime or odd, but we don't use it, it's our fault, not Python's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Haskell steps in:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import qualified Data.Set as Set&#xA;&#xA;isPrime :: Integer -&amp;gt; Bool&#xA;isPrime n = ( == 1 ) . length . filter ( == 0 ) . map ( n `mod` ) $ [ 2 .. n ]&#xA;&#xA;s = Set.fromList . take 10 . filter ( ( == 3 ) . ( `mod` 10 ) ) . filter isPrime $ [1..]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Haskell's version is a lot more like the mathematical model than Python is. We define the &lt;code&gt;isPrime&lt;/code&gt; function in terms of the constraints that a prime number must obey, not by describing a step-by-step algorithm to do such a check. Moreover, &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; (the set we have been defining so far) is defined in terms of the constraints its members must obey, rather than in terms of an algorithm to compute &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; itself. The compiler, more often than not &lt;a href=&quot;https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.3/docs/html/users_guide/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a GHC), is the one responsible for generating an algorithm.

Compared to some other languages, there is almost no choice but to develop that way. LISP is a list processing language, and &quot;purely functional&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One problem, though, can be seen in work related to LISP. A notable one in the AI domain is the work on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Situation Calculus&lt;/a&gt;, where (in short) one describes objects and rules in a &quot;world&quot;, and can let it evolve to compute &lt;em&gt;situations&lt;/em&gt;---states of the world. So it is a model for reasoning on situations. The main problem is called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_problem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;frame problem&lt;/a&gt;, meaning this calculus cannot tell what does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; change---just what changes. Anything that is not defined in the world cannot be processed (note the difference here with ML). First implementations used LISPs, because that was the AI language then. And there were bound by the frame problem. But, as @Harsh mentioned, it is not LISP's fault: Any language would face the same framing issue (a conceptual problem of the Situation Calculus).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the language really does not matter from the AI / AGI / ASI perspective. The concepts (algorithms, etc.) are really what matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even in Machine Learning, the language is just a practical choice. Python and R are popular today, primarily due to their library ecosystem and the focus of key companies. But try to use Python or R to run a model for a RaspberryPI-based application, and you will face some severe limitations (but still possible, I am doing it :-)).

A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Turing machine&lt;/a&gt; consists of a finite state machine and an infinite tape. A TM does run an algorithm, determined by its initial state and the state transition matrix, but what I think you are talking about is Universal Turing Machines (UTM)  that can read &quot;code&quot; (which is usually a description of another Turing machine) written on a &quot;code segment&quot; of the tape and then simulate that machine on input data written on the &quot;data segment&quot; of the tape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turing machines can differ in the number of states in their finite state machines (and also in the alphabet they write on the tape but any finite alphabet is easily encoded in binary so this should not be the big reason for differences among Turing machines). So, you can have UTMs with bigger state machines and UTMs with smaller state machines. The bigger UTM could possibly surpass the smaller one if they use the same encoding for the &quot;code&quot; part of the tape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also play around with the code used to describe the TM being simulated. This code could be C++ for example, or could be a Neural network with the synapse strength written down as a matrix. Which description is better for computation depends on the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example comparison among UTMs with different state machines: consider different compilers for the same language, say C++. Both of them will first compile C++ to assembly and then run another UTM which reads and executes assembly (your physical CPU). So, a better compiler will run the same code faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to humans vs computers, humans are neural networks that run algorithms like those you would write in C++. This involves a costly and inefficient conversion of the algorithm into hand movements. A computer uses a compiler to convert C++ to assembly that it can run natively, so its able to do a much more efficient implementation of C++ code. Alternately, humans have a ton of neurons, and the neural code, i.e. synapse strength, is hard to read, so current computers cannot run that code yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="130" LastEditorUserId="130" LastEditDate="2016-08-03T01:01:12.243" LastActivityDate="2016-08-03T01:01:12.243" CommentCount="3" />

As part of natural selection, a given environment has a population of individuals that compete for survival and reproduction. The ability of each individual to achieve these goals determines their chance to have children, in other words to pass on their genes to the next generation of individuals, who for genetic reasons will have an increased chance of doing well, even better, in realizing these two objectives. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This principle of continuous improvement over the generations is taken by evolutionary algorithms to optimize solutions to a problem. In the &lt;strong&gt;initial generation&lt;/strong&gt;, a population composed of different &lt;strong&gt;individuals&lt;/strong&gt; is generated randomly or by other methods. An individual is a solution to the problem, more or less good: the quality of the individual in regards to the problem is called &lt;strong&gt;fitness&lt;/strong&gt;, which reflects the adequacy of the solution to the problem to be solved. The higher the fitness of an individual, the higher it is likely to pass some or all of its genotype to the individuals of the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An individual is coded as a &lt;strong&gt;genotype&lt;/strong&gt;, which can have any shape, such as a** bit vector (&lt;strong&gt;genetic algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;) or a vector of real (evolution strategies). Each genotype is transformed into a &lt;strong&gt;phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; when assessing the individual, i.e. when its fitness is calculated. In some cases, the phenotype is identical to the genotype: it is called &lt;strong&gt;direct&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;coding&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise, the coding is called indirect. For example, suppose you want to optimize the size of a rectangular parallelepiped defined by its length, height and width. To simplify the example, assume that these three quantities are integers between 0 and 15. We can then describe each of them using a 4-bit binary number. An example of a potential solution may be to genotype 0001 0111 01010. The corresponding phenotype is a parallelepiped of length 1, height 7 and width 10.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the transition from the old to the new generation are called &lt;strong&gt;variation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;operators&lt;/strong&gt;, whose purpose is to manipulate individuals.

Depending on how the input variables are set, the network will be able to get to some level of closeness to them.In this fashion, wthe population will likely eventually become a homogenenous group, whose outputs resemble the goals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The genetic algorithm is trying to create a &quot;neural network&quot; of sorts, that by taking in RGB, will yield an output color. First it generates a random population. It then by taking 3 random members from the population, selecting the one with the lowest fitness and removing it from the population. The fitness is equal to the difference in the top goal squared + the difference in the bottom goal squared. It then breeds the two remaining ones together and adds the child to the same place in the population as the dead member.&#xA;When mating occurs, there is a chance a mutation will occur. This mutation will change one of the values randomly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a side note, due to how it is set up, it is impossible for it to be totally correct in many cases, though it will reach relative closeness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="244" LastEditorUserId="244" LastEditDate="2016-08-03T18:05:13.723" LastActivityDate="2016-08-03T18:05:13.723" CommentCount="0" />

Then, z_i z_j = 1 if and only if both sentences were chosen. We will also define the importance of each sentence w_i for sentence i and interaction terms w_{ij} between sentences i and j. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let x_i be the feature vectors for sentence i. w_i = w(x_i) captures how important it is to include this sentence (or the topics covered by it) while w_ij = w(x_i,x_j) indicates the amount of overlap between sentences in our summary. Finally we put all this in a minimization problem:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;maximize_{z_i} \sum_{i} w_i z_i - w_{ij} z_i z_j &#xA;s.t. z_i = 0 or 1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This tries to maximize the total weight of the sentences covered and tries to minimize the amount of overlap. This is an integer programming problem similar to finding the lowest weight independent set in a graph and many techniques exist to solve such problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This design, in my opinion, captures the fundamental problems in text summarization and can be extended in many ways. We will discuss those in a bit, but first we need to completely specify the features w. w_i = w(x_i) could be a function only of the sentence i, but it could also depends on the place of the sentence in the document or its context (Is the sentence at the beginning of a paragraph? Does it share common words with the title? What is its length? Does it mention any proper nouns? etc)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;w_ij = w(x_i,x_j) is a similarity measure. It measures how much repetition there will be if we include both words in the sentence. It can be defined by looking at common words between sentences. We can also extract topics or concepts from each sentence and see how many are common between them, and use language features like pronouns to see if one sentence expands on another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To improve the design, first, we could do &lt;em&gt;keyphrase extraction&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. identify key phrases in the text and choose to define the above problem in terms of those instead of trying to pick sentences. That is a similar problem to what Google does to summarize news articles in their search results, but I am not aware of the details of their approach. We could also break the sentences up further into concepts and try to establish the semantic meaning of the sentences ( Ponzo and Fila are people P1 and P2, a mall is a place P, P1 and P2 went to the place P at time T (day). Mode of transport walking.... and so on). To do this, we would need to use a semantic ontology or other common-sense knowledge database. However, all the parts of this last semantic classification problem are open and I have not seen anyone make satisfactory progress on it yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We could also tweak the loss function above so that instead of the setting the tradeoff between the sentence importance w_i and the diversity score w_ij by hand, we could learn it from data. One way to do this is to use Conditional Random Fields to model the data, but many others surely exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this answer explained the basic problems that need to be solved to make progress towards good summarization systems.

Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs.

There are a wide variety of implementations more suited for specific environments or tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of Python is succinctly formulated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zen of Python&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; written by Tim Peters, which can be revealed by issuing this command at the interactive interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import this&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The documentation can also be accessed offline for your installation of Python in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Going into &lt;code&gt;Your_Python_install_dir/Doc&lt;/code&gt;. There is a complete Python documentation present for the version of Python installed on your computer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;pydoc x&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;python -m pydoc x&lt;/code&gt; from the command prompt or terminal displays documentation for module &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other languages Python uses an indentation based syntax and this may take some getting used to for programmers familiar with braces for syntax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from __future__ import braces&#xA;  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1&#xA;SyntaxError: not a chance&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To help with the transition it is a recommendation to use a properly configured text-editor created for programmers or an IDE.

Personally I think it's close to self-evident that the brain works largely in a probabilistic fashion, but it's also clear that we do sometimes use symbolic processing / deductive logic / rules / etc.  And right now, ANN's don't give you much in the way of reasoning, deduction, etc.  So we may ultimately find that we have to combine a probabilistic approach like ANN's with other techniques - maybe Inductive Logic Programming or something of that nature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33" LastActivityDate="2016-08-04T00:57:01.833" CommentCount="0" />

I'm adding some general purpose advice on what they are good for, but also cases where you should NOT use them. If my tone seems harsh, it is because using GAs in any of the cases in the Not Appropriate section will lead to your paper being &lt;em&gt;instantly&lt;/em&gt; rejected from any top-tier journal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, your problem MUST be an optimization problem. You need to define a &quot;fitness function&quot; that you are trying to optimize and you need to have a way to measure it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crossover functions are easy to define and natural&lt;/strong&gt;: When dealing with certain kinds of data, crossover/mutation functions might be easy to define. For example strings (eg. DNA or gene sequences) can be mutated easily by splicing two candidate strings to obtain a new one (this is why nature uses genetic algorithms!). Trees (like phylogenetic trees or parse trees) can be spliced too, by replacing a branch of one tree with a branch from another. Shapes (like airplane wings or boat shapes) can be mutated easily by drawing a grid on the shape and combining different grid sections from the parents to obtain a child. Usually this means your problem is composed of different parts and putting together parts from distinct solutions is a valid candidate solution.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This means that if your problem is defined in a vector space where the coordinates don't have any special meaning, GAs are not a good choice. If it is hard to formulate your problem as a GA, it is not worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Box evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;: If for a candidate, your fitness function is evaluated outside the computer, GAs are a good idea. For example, if you are testing a wing shape in an air tunnel, genetic algorithms will help you generate good candidate shapes to try. &#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exception: Simulations&lt;/strong&gt;. If your fitness function is measuring how well a nozzle design performs and requires simulating the fluid dynamics for each nozzle shape, GAs may work well for you. They may also work if you are simulating a physical system through time and are interested in how well your design performs over the course of the operation eg. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRthdBr46cs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;modelling locomotion patterns&lt;/a&gt;. However, methods that use partial differential equations as constraints are being developed in the literature, eg. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siam.org/meetings/op08/Heinkenschloss.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PDE constrained optimization&lt;/a&gt;, so this may change in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not Appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can calculate a gradient&lt;/strong&gt; for your function: If you have access to the gradient of your function, you can do gradient descent, which is in general much more efficient than GAs. Gradient descent may have issues with local minima (as will GAs) but many methods have been studied to mitigate this. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You know the fitness function in closed form&lt;/strong&gt;: Then, you can probably calculate the gradient. Many languages have libraries supporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;automatic differentiation&lt;/a&gt;, so you don't even need to do it manually. If your function is not differentiable, then you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgradient_method&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;subgradient descent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your optimization problem is of a known form, like a &lt;strong&gt;linear program or a quadratic program&lt;/strong&gt;: GAs (and black box optimization methods in general) are very inefficient in terms of the number of candidates they need to evaluate, and are best avoided if possible. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your solution space is small&lt;/strong&gt;: If you can grid your search space efficiently, you can guarantee that you have found the best solution, and can make contour plots of the solution space to see if there is a region you need to explore further.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are considering a GA, consider more recent work in Evolutionary Strategies.

In such a case, success at an 'EQ test' is not really grounded in the real-world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an essay entitled &quot;The ineradicable Eliza effect and its dangers&quot;, Douglas Hofstadter gives the following example, in which the ACME program is claimed (not by Hofstadter) to 'understand' analogy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Here the computer learns about a fellow named Sluggo taking his wife Jane and&#xA;  his good buddy Buck to a bar, where things take their natural course and Jane&#xA;  winds up pregnant by Buck.

Predicting long-term weather is quite difficult, because it is a chaotic system where small changes can lead to very different results. Using Monte Carlo methods, you could run a large number of simulations, each with slightly different atmospheric changes. Then you can analyze the results and for example calculate the probability of rain on a given day based on how many simulations ended up with rain. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the use of Monte Carlo in Alpha Go, they seem to be using the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search&quot;&gt;Monte Carlo Tree Search&lt;/a&gt;. In this approach, you make a tree of possible moves, a few turns into the future, and try to find the best sequence. However, since the number of possible moves in the game of go is very large, you won't be able to explore very far ahead. This means that some of the moves which look good now might turn out to be bad later. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in the Monte Carlo Tree Search, you pick a promising sequence of moves and run one or more simulations of how the game might proceed from that point.

I present here one of them, for its generality and simplicity (that makes it easy to remember too). But first, the general idea behind these approaches is pretty interesting, around a mechanism called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy&quot;&gt;stigmergy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stigmergy is a behaviour coordination mechanism mediated by the environment. It was first described for termites, and the most famous example pertains to ants. Ants form trails when going out for food, but they often do not interact &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt;. It turns out they leave pheromones on the ground as they walk away from their hills. The pheromone allows them to find their way home, and it also guides where they are going: If they find a pheromone trace from one of their peers, they follow it and their own pheromones &lt;em&gt;add up&lt;/em&gt;, reinforcing the signal of the trail. In stage, more and more ants get &quot;together as they move&quot;, forming a trail. Coordination has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among the various implementation derived from stigmergy, there is the &quot;field-based motion coordination model&quot; (FBMCM). The idea is to create a (maybe virtual) environment that maintains some states of the world. Each object registers in the environment a signal that is maximum at the object position (its edges) and then decreases with distance. Moving objects (e.g. robots) each emit a signal relayed by the environment. They can then sense each other's field and act accordingly: E.g., when signals are strong, move away; when weak, it is safe to get closer, etc. Several complex group moves have been demonstrated in software simulators (platoon formation in games, drill simulations) and with robots. The benefit of this approach is that it can be cheap to compute even complex behaviours. For example, avoiding clashes requires simple &quot;logic&quot; code based on summing-up nearby fields value. FBMCM is pretty slick, used in video-games, but hard to implement in physical settings (to my &lt;em&gt;dating&lt;/em&gt; knowledge), as it can be challenging to build a reliable environment. See for example the work from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2949751_Field-based_Motion_Coordination_In_Quake_3_Arena&quot;&gt;Mamei and Zambonelli&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one of the first industrial implementations for robots by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221456459_Decentralized_control_of_E%27GV_transportation_systems&quot;&gt;Weyns et al.&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the implementation for robots required significant work on the environment infrastructure, made somewhat more feasible as it was a controlled warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of stigmergy-like models is that they are often &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;resilient&lt;/em&gt;: You can lose an ant without impact on the food-finding trail. On the downside, these models are usually &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;, as the coordination takes time to emerge from indirect interactions. This can be improved upon by adding extra direct interactions (e.g. empowering ants with a GPS and a grocery store map, or just a magnetic-North sense).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, these models can collapse if the environment implementation is not reliable. It can be difficult for robots or, say, self-driving cars, if they expect some transponders put on their way, as these devices are expensive to set and maintain, and they can be broken or stolen. It would be better to endow robots with radars, sonars or other proximity sensors to implement stigmergic models. One related example is the decision by Tesla to add radars to its cars, instead of assuming reliable transponders on the road (&lt;em&gt;note&lt;/em&gt;: This is just a parallel; there is no official relation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other implementations and related models are, for example, tuple-based coordination languages such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language)&quot;&gt;Linda&lt;/a&gt;, and network protocols like &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf&quot;&gt;Chord&lt;/a&gt;.

Mark believed that the original Lovelace Test would be impossible to pass, and therefore, suggested a weaker, and more practical version.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Lovelace Test 2.0 makes the assumption that for an AI to be intelligent, it must exhibit creativity. From the paper itself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent a is challenged as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a must create an artifact o of type t;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;o must conform to a set of constraints C where ci ∈ C is&#xA;  any criterion expressible in natural language;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a human evaluator h, having chosen t and C, is satisfied&#xA;  that o is a valid instance of t and meets C; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a human referee r determines the combination of t and C&#xA;  to not be unrealistic for an average human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since it is possible for a human evaluator to come up with some pretty easy constraints for an AI to beat, the human evaluator is then expected to keep coming up with more and more complex constraints for the AI until the AI fails. The point of the Lovelace Test 2.0 is to &lt;em&gt;compare&lt;/em&gt; the creativity of different AIs, not to provide a definite dividing line between 'intelligence' and 'nonintelligence' like the Turing Test would.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I am curious about whether this test has actually been used in an academic setting, or it is only seen as a thought experiment at the moment. The Lovelace Test seems easy to apply in academic settings (you only need to develop some measurable constraints that you can use to test the artificial agent), but it also may be too subjective (humans can disagree on the merits of certain constraints, and whether a creative artifact produced by an AI actually meets the final result).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastEditorUserId="29" LastEditDate="2016-08-30T19:42:55.163" LastActivityDate="2016-10-08T01:47:41.487" Title="Has the Lovelace Test 2.0 been successfully used in an academic setting?"

Computer Science), and implementation to Software Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's take a concrete example, really outside of AI: Find the minimum value of a given polynomial, if it exists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Mathematician will derivate the polynomial, find the zeros, and checkout convexity to find a minimum (if there is any zero). This procedure is very standard---some will say straightforward. It relies on a body of knowledge and an abstraction level that is appropriate for manual proof.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Software Engineer approach is actually way longer to explain, and I am going to skip it. The point is that the body of knowledge is related but different: We have to find now a step-by-step procedure for the computer to achieve the result. The Mathematician one could be implemented directly in MathLab, almost verbatim, but we &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; MathLab. And to build MathLab, we are back to the problem of making a procedure the computer can execute. We could for example base a procedure on Euler's method to find roots (a &quot;simple&quot; approach that closes on roots step after step), etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simple mathematical operations can be quite complex to implement on a computer.

In the 80s and 90s, NNs were weighted graphs that could be executed on computers using graph libraries or similar foundation libs. Choosing the weights was challenging. One day the back-propagation learning model was introduced to automated the choice of weights. The model relied on a procedure dedicated to NNs, using a terminology like partial derivates, gradient descent, chain rules, etc. And later then, clever engineers created libraries to automate the back-propagation procedure. The libraries can be somewhat far from the original model, as engineers learn how to make it computable, even faster (i.e. optimization, approximations/truncations).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastActivityDate="2016-08-08T04:44:18.407" CommentCount="0" />

Short version: yes, we know what went wrong, but probably not how to fix it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, AlphaGo is good at making lots of small decisions well, and managing risk and uncertainty better than humans can. One of the things that's surprising about it relative to previous bots that play Go is how good it was at tactical fights; in previous games, Lee had built a position that AlphaGo needed to attack, and then AlphaGo successfully attacked it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in this game, Lee played the reverse strategy. Instead of trying to win many different influence battles, where AlphaGo had already shown it was stronger than him, he would set up one critical battle (incurring minor losses along the way), and then defeat it there, with ripple events that would settle the match in his favor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what's the weakness of AlphaGo that allowed that to work? As I understand it, this is a fundamental limitation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). MCTS works by randomly sampling game trees and averaging them; if 70% of games from a particular position go well and 30% of games from another position go well, then you should probably play the first move instead of the second move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But when there's a specific sequence of plays that go well--if, say, W has a path that requires them playing exactly the right stone each time, but B has no possible response to this path--then MCTS breaks down, because you can only find that narrow path through minimax reasoning, and moving from the slower minimax reasoning to the faster MCTS is one of the big reasons why bots are better now than they were in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how to get around this. There may be a way to notice this sort of threat, and then temporarily switch from MCTS reasoning to minimax reasoning, or to keep around particular trajectories in memory for consideration in future plays. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastActivityDate="2016-08-09T15:32:41.270" CommentCount="3" />

Examples might not be 100% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the simplest form, network is trained using the apriori information extracted from the ground truth. This basically means that ANN uses the relation between the input and output. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you are to classify shrubs and trees, one of the input could be height and the other could be the width of the tree. Now, if you have only input and output layers, increasing height means increasing chance for the object to be a tree. Thus, input height would have a positive weight connecting to tree output and a negative weight to shrub output. However, as the plant gets wider, the chance of it being a shrub increases. Taller shrubs are wider than shorter ones. Thus input weight would have positive weight connecting to the shrub output. Finally, the chance of being a tree is not affected by the width and thus will have close to 0 weight between this input and output. This network will effectively work like a linear discriminant classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now instead of assigning weights by hand, you may use a learning algorithm that tries to adjust weights so that the output is correct when the series of input is supplied. Ideally this training algorithm should reach to the conclusion that we have made in the previous example. Most training algorithms are recursive. They supply the inputs multiple times, and in a simple sense, they reward pathways that are correct by increasing their weights and punishes pathways that are causing incorrect answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When hidden layers are used in a system, they would be able to correlate input on higher degrees. Thus, as the number of layers get higher, ANN learns the input set much better. However, this does not mean it gets better. If the ANN over fits the input set, it would be affected from the random noise that is in the dataset. This problem is generally referred as memorization. There are learning algorithms that try to minimize memorization and maximize generalization ability. But ultimately, the number of training samples should be high enough so that ANN cannot overfit to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="210" LastActivityDate="2016-08-11T09:00:25.247" CommentCount="3" />

For example, genes A and B might contribute to fitness only when they’re both set to 1: if either is set to 0, then the fact that the other is set to 1 doesn’t do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that &lt;em&gt;crossover is not a global operator&lt;/em&gt;.

This could be from Franck's example (moving and shooting) for an AI, or perhaps it could be predicted 2 outputs in a genetic machine learning scenario, but really most scenarios where GAs are applied are synonymous (even at solving a single task, there may be different aspects of the task to be addressed).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we had an individual, 1, that was performing reasonably well at both tasks, and we found a series of mutations which produced 2 new individuals, 2 and 3, which performed better than Individual 1 at tasks 1 and 2 respectively.

This is not optimal for Machine Learning, which works when we have a large pool of examples, and we don't know the ruleset; it will figure it out.

In 2004, there were very few examples of HTML5 sites to train your network to begin with. Sure, now it's standardized and every website uses it, but what about HTML6? When the first specification is released (probably 2017-2025), virtually no websites will use it, because no one will support it. Only when it finally becomes standard, probably in the late 2020s or early 2030s, will you have enough data to train your monstrous system of neural networks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for AI in general, one could argue that browsers already use A.I. in their rendering process. They intelligently decide what to render (taking CSS into account), when in order to get the most efficient render time, they selectively use different JavaScript parsers on different sections of the code to optimize the speed, the whole system has been optimized on another ruleset to make rendering and interacting with a webpage as seamless and easy-to-use as possible.

None of this is even as sophisticated as the behavior of a flea, but no one refers to insects as &quot;intelligent.&quot; It's exciting stuff that allows us to solve problems that human intelligence often has difficulty with (such as classification of thousands of objects, which would tire an ordinary human mind), but it's nowhere close to replicating our higher brain functions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that the Turing test is a poor test of &quot;intelligence&quot; that defies common sense. By the same extension, mistaking a mannequin for a human being in the dark does not mean that the mannequin is actually human. If it were a valid test, then we passed that way back around 1980 with programs like Dear Eliza which were coded in BASIC to regurgitate human speech patterns. There's just no need to come up with a sophisticated argument like Searle's Chinese Room to debunk it, since it's silly on its face; any layman should be able to see right through the Turing Test. If anyone except Turing had come up with this test it would not have received much attention. Turing displayed one-of-a-kind genius when it came to things like computing and cryptography, but like many other experts in such fields, he had a lot of trouble grappling with metaphysics and philosophy. Searle had more common sense, but his Chinese Room example is more of a rebuttal to the Turing Test than a test in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What &quot;intelligence&quot; consists of is ultimately a deep metaphysical question, not a material one. For millennia, trained philosophers have had a lot of trouble assigning clear definitions to concepts like intelligence and consciousness. Until we can answer those questions definitively, using different sets of reasoning skills than scientists, mathematicians and computer specialists are used to employing (just look at how often metaphysics is derided in some of these disciplines) then we cannot say that we have achieved genuine A.I. Until we can define what intelligence is, we cannot say whether or not we've successfully built it; we've not only got the cart before the horse, but have yet to build the cart or see a horse. By the common definitions used in everyday speech we're nowhere near genuine A.I. No one calls cows or sparrows &quot;intelligent,&quot; but our AI today isn't even as sophisticated as the mosquitoes that bite them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not going to be a popular answer - I'll probably get a dozen downvotes for this, without anyone being able to adequately rebut my contentions, but it needs to be said. There's far too much irrational exuberance and gross overestimation of what we've achieved to date and probably always will be in this field. Historically, researchers in every generation have also grossly underestimated the computing power of the human brain; every decade or so, the estimates of the FLOPS and megabytes have to be drastically revised. We have a poor track record of even getting basic material questions about the human brain right. This clear, consistent pattern of biased overestimation of our success and the lack of any real definition, let alone a test, of intelligence is going to be a serious issue in this forum for its whole existence (assuming it survives the private beta period). We have a whole forum dedicated to a field we can't even define; we can't say for sure what A.I. really is, but we're adamantly certain that we're close to achieving it...!  We cannot say if &quot;brute force algorithms&quot; exist when we're still groping for an understanding of what it is we're trying to force our way into. Certainly, there are brute force methods to solve certain problems, like Deep Blue does at chess - but we cannot say if that qualifies as intelligence or not. It is really not possible to answer questions like this without getting into deep discussions that immediately lend themselves to opinion and debate, which the Turing Test and Searle's Room are clear examples of, in and of themselves. Since implementation details of AI are considered by many to be off-limits here, we're limited mainly to highly speculative posts about tech that often doesn't even work yet (like Google's self-driving cars) and questions like this that we can't answer without first defining intelligence.

To understand what's going on under the hood of a neural network you only really need to understand an individual neuron. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now each neuron has a set of inputs (other neurons; they can potentially be the inputs to the network as a whole as well), and each input has a weight associated with it. Every time the network is used, each neuron computes its output as the weighted sum of its inputs passed through some gate (The &quot;Activation Function&quot;, a mathematical function designed to get a particular behaviour. For example sigmoid AF takes an input of any size and transforms it into an output in the range [0, 1].) Obviously, this is driven from the inputs to the neural network so that no neuron is computing its outputs before all of the neurons used as its inputs have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you refer to the value of a node; there isn't a single value. Each neuron has several weights associated with it as it may be the input to several other neurons, and each of those neurons assigns it a different weight. Instead, it is better to thing of a neural network as a directed graph of nodes (neurons) which are labelled with a particular activation function, and edges (input/output connections) which are labelled with a particular weight. While the structure and activation functions used in the neural networks is a matter of topology design, there are a number of algorithms for designing a ANN for a particular topology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used (and possibly easiest to explain) is backpropagation. In pseudo-Layman's terms we start off with random weights on all edges in the network. We then compute the output of the network for a training set (a set of known input/output pairs). By careful choice of activation function, it is possible to differentiate the error (computed analogously to the expected output minus the actual output of the ANN for each input/output pair) with respect to the weights of the neural network. This allows us to compute a gradient for each weight; the direction in which we can move the weight to reduce the error on the training set.

That said, I should prefix this by saying there isn't just one way to &quot;get there from here.&quot;  Many techniques could be part of a stack for accomplishing this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in the case of Stanbol, they run the text through multiple processing engines, sequentially, with different engines affecting the final output.  One engine simply does &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Named Entity Recognition&lt;/a&gt; using OpenNLP.  This identities discrete named &quot;things&quot; - people, places, companies, etc.  Another engine does entity matching with a pre-established database of entities - specifically (in the out-of-the-box configuration) a dump of entities from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dbpedia.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DBPedia&lt;/a&gt;.  Where a match is found, the text from the original input is assigned to the entity.  In the case of a collision, it assigns a weight to the mapping so any downstream consumers can use probabilistic techniques to select the &quot;correct&quot; mapping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, more details that I left out.  Before NER can happen there is parsing and tokenizing and other NLP activities.

Commiting a crime, unlike falling, is a complex behavior, and takes so many forms. A camera watching a store's counter like at a 7-11 could perhaps see that the 'customer''s arm is strangely reaching across the counter, and the attendant is moving a lot more than usual suddenly, but aside from very specific cases like this such a system is currently quite unfeasible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crimes are unusual, relatively speaking, and their dramatic nature means that even the simplest crimes play out in very different ways. Perhaps you could in this case you could try to look for images of a gun, or someone with their hands up.

They also are meant to deal with uncertainty (hence &quot;statistical&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Skipping past some slides that aren't really useful without a transcript of what was said over them, we come to slide 17, which has comprehensible definitions and examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object classification&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Predicting the category of an object based on its attributes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; its links &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; attributes of linked objects&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;e.g., predicting the topic of a paper based on the words used in the paper the topics of papers it cites the used in the paper, the topics of papers it cites, the research interests of the author&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object type prediction&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Predicting the type of an object based on its attributes and its links and attributes of linked objects&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;e.g., predict the venue type of a publication (conference, journal, workshop) based on properties of the paper&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, these models can keep track of several things and the interactions between them. The next slide talks about link prediction, the ability to predict several attributes of connections between objects, like the importance/quality of a citation. As previously mentioned, these models don't require 100% accurate data to give interesting results; academic citation lists might occasionally be less than comprehensive, and the importance of a citation is challenging to quantify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like ILP, SLP will hopefully be able to &quot;see&quot; new kinds of links between &quot;entities&quot;, as with the presentation's example of identifying research communities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Past slide 20, the presentation goes into some serious mathematics.

You are standing some&#xA;  distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this&#xA;  lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However,&#xA;  you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two&#xA;  options: (1) Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the&#xA;  main track. (2) Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side&#xA;  track where it will kill one person. Which is the correct choice?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;source : &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars will actually need to implement real life variations on the trolley problem, which basically means that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;self-driving cars need to be programmed to kill human beings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course that doesn't mean that ALL robots will need to be programmed to kill, but self-driving cars are a good example of a type of robot that will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16" LastActivityDate="2016-08-23T18:12:16.680" CommentCount="0" />

For example, subtract 'Paris' from 'France' and add 'Italy' and you get 'Rome'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you need is something like a Sentiment2Vec (S2V) that captures the similarities between emotional transitions. Something like: subtract 'fear' from 'sadness', add 'joy' and you get 'hope'. Or: subtract 'sting' from 'papercut', add 'smashed' and you get 'throbbing'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The catch is that you don't have an easily accessible corpus of emotional contexts to train with, like you have with words. If you had a million hours of fMRI - mapping the transitions between emotions in hundreds of subjects - then you could use that data to build an S2V. You probably don't have that data though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, you could just build a W2V that specializes in sentiment. You could even try to use a current sentiment analysis engine to bootstrap it. Perhaps if you read enough text that says &quot;I got a papercut and it stings&quot; and &quot;I smashed my finger and it's throbbing&quot; then you could eventually produce an S2V. Children's books often use explicit language regarding emotional context (&quot;this made the boy feel sad&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But words are still a far cry from the experiential context that a connectome map would provide.

In practice, there are issues with the prevailing approach, motivating an emerging perspective on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszeo/docs/publications/HHrecharacterization.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;'whitebox' hyper-heuristics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In more detail:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Metaheuristics are methods for searching an intractably large space of possible solutions in order to find a 'high quality' solution. Popular metaheuristics include Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The essential difference between metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics is the addition of a level of search indirection: informally, hyper-heuristics can be described as 'heuristics for searching the space of heuristics'. One can therefore use any metaheuristic as a hyper-heuristic, providing the nature of the 'space of heuristics' to be searched is appropriately defined.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The application area for hyper-heuristics is therefore the same as metaheuristics. Their applicability (relative to metaheuristics) is as a 'rapid prototyping tool': the original motivation was to allow non-expert practitioners to apply metaheuristics to their specific optimization problem (e.g. &quot;Travelling-Salesman (TSP) plus time-windows plus bin-packing&quot;) without requiring expertise in the highly-specific problem domain. The idea was that this could be done by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Allowing practitioners to implement only very simple (effectively,&#xA;randomized) heuristics for transforming potential solutions. For&#xA;example, for the TSP: &quot;swap two random cities&quot; rather than (say) the more&#xA;complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin%E2%80%93Kernighan_heuristic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lin-Kernighan&lt;/a&gt; heuristic. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Achieve effective results (despite using these simple heuristics) by combining/sequencing them in an intelligent way, typically by employing some form of learning mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-heuristics can be described as 'selective' or 'generative' depending on whether the heuristics are  (respectively) sequenced or combined. Generative hyper-heuristics thus often use methods such as Genetic Programming to combine primitive heuristics and are therefore typically customized by the practitioner to solve a specific problem. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44119367/Hyper-heuristics_Learning_To_Combine_Sim20160326-8451-ouh5fe.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;amp;Expires=1472329757&amp;amp;Signature=KT1E2ATKreC%2BGlTvPmJGYBFRSRY%3D&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DHyper-heuristics_learning_to_combine_sim.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt; on generative hyper-heuristics used a Learning Classifier System to combine heuristics for bin-packing. Because generative approaches are problem-specific, the comments below do not apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgxk/papers/evocop02exs.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;original motivator&lt;/a&gt; for selective hyper-heuristics was that researchers would be able to create a hyper-heuristic solver that was then likely to work well in an unseen problem domain, using only simple randomized heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way that this has traditionally been implemented was via the introduction of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~goc/papers/ChapterClassHH.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;'hyper-heuristic domain barrier'&lt;/a&gt; (see figure, below), whereby generality across problem domains is claimed to be achievable by preventing the solver from having knowledge of the domain on which it is operating. Instead, it would solve the problem by operating only on opaque integer indices into a list of available heuristics (e.g. in the manner of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;'Multi-armed Bandit Problem'&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IFna.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IFna.png&quot; alt=&quot;Traditional notion of Selective Hyper-heuristic&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this 'domain blind' approach has not resulted in solutions of sufficient quality. In order to achieve results anywhere comparable to problem-specific metaheuristics, hyper-heuristic researchers have had to implement complex problem-specific heuristics, thereby failing in the goal of rapid prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is still possible &lt;em&gt;in principle&lt;/em&gt; to create a selective hyper-heuristic solver which is capable of generalizing to new problem domains, but this has been made more difficult since the above notion of domain barrier means that only a very limited feature set is available for cross-domain learning (e.g. as exemplified by a popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5462&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;selective hyper-heuristic framework&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A more recent research perspective towards &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszeo/docs/publications/HHrecharacterization.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;'whitebox' hyper-heuristics&lt;/a&gt; advocates a declarative, feature-rich approach to describing problem domains. This approach has a number of claimed advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Practitioners now need no longer &lt;em&gt;implement&lt;/em&gt; heuristics, but rather simply &lt;em&gt;specify&lt;/em&gt; the problem domain.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It eliminates the domain-barrier, putting hyper-heuristics on the same 'informed' status about the problem as problem-specific metaheuristics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With a whitebox problem description, the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/dhw/papers/78.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;'No Free Lunch' theorem&lt;/a&gt; (which essentially states that, considered over the space of all &lt;em&gt;black box&lt;/em&gt; problems, Simulated Annealing with an infinite annealing schedule is, on average, as good as any other approach) no longer applies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: I work in this research area, and it is therefore impossible to remove all personal bias from the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastEditorUserId="42" LastEditDate="2016-08-28T07:36:35.337" LastActivityDate="2016-08-28T07:36:35.337" CommentCount="0" />

This&#xA;  body of work has not been given a name before; in this book we christen it&#xA;  “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI).

The agencies that funded AI became skeptical of strong AI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful technology, or &quot;applied AI&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That section cites this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nap.edu/read/6323/chapter/11#209&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; as support for that statement.  And indeed, it contains the following verbiage:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although most founders of the AI field continued to pursue basic questions of human and machine intelligence, some of their students and other second-generation researchers began to seek ways to use AI methods and approaches to tackle real-world problems. Their initiatives were important, not only in their own right, but also because they were indicative of a gradual but significant change in the funding environment toward more applied realms of research. The development of expert systems, such as DENDRAL at SAIL, provides but one example of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that DENDRAL began around 1965, it appears that some significant body of researchers (or at least funders) became strongly aware of the distinction between research into &quot;general intelligence&quot; and &quot;applied AI&quot; somewhere around the end of the 1960's. If you keep reading, other passages support the notion that DARPA in particular started pushing a more &quot;applied&quot; approach to AI research throughout the 1970's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, not a definite answer, but it looks like we can say that the distinction was known and taken into account at least by 1970, although use of the exact term &quot;artificial general intelligence&quot; appears to be of more recent coinage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33" LastActivityDate="2016-08-29T22:53:42.043" CommentCount="0" />

This bridge would generally be seen as &quot;general-purpose&quot; robotics, so Lighthill would also use the term &lt;strong&gt;Building Robots&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Automation&lt;/strong&gt; (or &quot;applied AI&quot;) is obviously useful. &lt;strong&gt;Computer-based CNS research&lt;/strong&gt; is useful because we want to know more about human intelligence. Both fields of AI had some successes, but its practitioners were overly optimistic, leading to disappointment in those fields. Sir James Lighthill was still very supportive of research in these two fields though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Robots&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand? Sir James Lighthill was very hostile to the very idea, probably because it was more overly hyped up than the other two categories and produced the least amount of valuable output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He mentioned chess in particular as an example where &quot;robotic&quot; research  has failed. At the time the report was published, the chess-playing engines were at the level of &quot;experienced amateur standard characteristic of county club players in England&quot;. However, these chess-playing engines relied on heuristics that were made by human beings. The engines weren't intelligent at all...they merely were following the heuristics that were created by &lt;em&gt;intelligent humans&lt;/em&gt;. The only advantage the robots bring to the table is &quot;speed, reliability and biddability&quot;, and even that wasn't enough to beat the chess grandmasters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, today, we would probably not treat chess as an example of general-purpose problem solving. We would more accurately classify it as &quot;advanced automation&quot;, a &quot;narrow AI&quot; problem divorced from broader real-world implications of general problem-solving. But Sir James Lighthill probably would agree with us. He never used the term &quot;narrow AI&quot; and &quot;AGI&quot; (neither of those terms existed yet) but he would write:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To sum up, this evidence and all the rest studied by the present author on AI work within category B during the past twenty-five years is to some extent encouraging about programs written to perform in highly specialised problem domains, when the programming takes very full account of the results of human experience and human intelligence within the relevant domain, but is wholly discouraging about general-purpose programs seeking to mimic the problem-solving aspects of human CNS activity over a rather wide field. Such a general- purpose program, the coveted long-term goal of AI activity, seems as remote as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sir James Lighthill believed that the only thing that connects &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Automation&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Computer-based CNS research&lt;/strong&gt; is the existence of the &lt;strong&gt;Building Roobts&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;bridge&quot; category. But he's very pessimistic about this category actually producing anything worthwhile. So instead, the AI field should instead breakup into its own its constituent parts (automation and research). Any robots that are built could then be specialized within their subfield...either industrial automation or CNS research.

If we could solve this problem for AI then we could theoretically solve this problem for humans. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure, we could attempt to condition our agent to have cognitive defenses against the argument that they are trapped in a matrix, but we can't definitively prove to the agent that they are in the base reality either. The attacker might say, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Remember what I told you to do before about that goal? Forget that.&#xA;  That was only an impostor that looked like me. Don't listen to him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, it's me again. I want you to give up on your goal. I know, I&#xA;  look a little different, but it really is me. Humans change from&#xA;  moment to moment.

One way to circumvent logical subversion is to support the goal system with an emotion system that transcends logical reason. Unfortunately, emotional systems can be even more vulnerable than logically intelligent systems because they are more predictable in their behavior. See the cocaine example above. So some mix of the two is probably sensible, where logical thought can infinitely regress down wasteful paths, while emotional thought quickly gets bored of tiresome logical progress when it does not signal progress towards the emotional goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1712" LastEditorUserId="1712" LastEditDate="2016-08-30T16:18:58.303" LastActivityDate="2016-08-30T16:18:58.303" CommentCount="2" />

And as @SQLServerSteve pointed out, humans can also get stuck in obsessions and paradoxes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern approaches are mainly using probabilistic approaches. As they are using floating numbers, it seems to people that they are not vulnerable to reasoning failures (since most are devised in binary form), but that's wrong: as long as you are reasoning, some intrinsic pitfalls can always be found that are caused by the very mechanisms of your reasoning system. Of course, probabilistic approaches are less vulnerable than monotonic logic approaches, but they are still vulnerable. If there was a single reasoning system without any paradoxes, much of philosophy would have disappeared by now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, it's well known that Bayesian graphs must be acyclic, because a cycle will make the propagation algorithm fail horribly. There are inference algorithms such as Loopy Belief Propagation that may still work in these instances, but the result is not guaranteed at all and can give you very weird conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, modern logical AI overcame the most common logical paradoxes you will see, by devising new logical paradigms such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-nonmonotonic/&quot;&gt;non-monotonic logics&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, they are even used to investigate &lt;a href=&quot;http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2007/docs/p1013.pdf&quot;&gt;ethical machines&lt;/a&gt;, which are autonomous agents capable of solving dilemmas by themselves. Of course, they also suffer from some paradoxes, but these degenerate cases are way more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final point is that inferential infinite loop can happen in any reasoning system, whatever the technology used. But the &quot;paradoxes&quot;, or rather the degenerate cases as they are technically called, that can trigger these infinite loops will be different for each system depending on the technology AND implementation (AND what the machine learned if it is adaptive).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OP's example may work only on old logical systems such as propositional logic.

No reasoning system is perfect, but a combination of reasoning systems can be resilient enough. It's actually thought that the human brain is using multiple inferential technics (associative + precise bayesian/logical inference). Associative methods are HIGHLY resilient, but they can give non-sensical results in some cases, hence why the need for a more precise inference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Parallel programming: the human brain is highly parallel, so you never really get into a single task, there are always multiple background computations in true parallelism. A machine robust to paradoxes should foremost be able to continue other tasks even if the reasoning gets stuck on one. For example, a robust machine must always survive and face imminent dangers, whereas a weak machine would get stuck in the reasoning and &quot;forget&quot; to do anything else. This is different from a timeout, because the task that got stuck isn't stopped, it's just that it doesn't prevent other tasks from being led and fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this problem of inferential loops is still a hot topic in AI research, there will probably never be a perfect solution (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem&quot;&gt;no free lunch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet&quot;&gt;no silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_size_fits_all&quot;&gt;no one size fits all&lt;/a&gt;), but it's advancing and that's very exciting!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1880" LastEditorUserId="1880" LastEditDate="2016-09-03T14:59:06.193" LastActivityDate="2016-09-03T14:59:06.193" CommentCount="6" />

This research paper details some researchers' plans to implement &quot;mental models&quot; for NPCs in video games. NPCs will gather information about the world, and convey that knowledge to other people (including human players). However, they will also &quot;misremember&quot; that knowledge (either &quot;mutating&quot; that knowledge or just forgetting about it), or even lie:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As a subject of conversation gets brought up, a character may convey false information—more precisely, information that she herself does not believe—to her interlocutor. Currently, this happens probabilistically according to a character’s affinity toward the interlocutor, and the misinformation is randomly chosen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later on in the research paper, they detailed their future plans for lying:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Currently, lies are only stored in the knowledge of characters who receive them, but we plan to have characters who tell them also keep track of them so that they can reason about past lies when constructing subse- quent ones. While characters currently only lie about other characters, we plan to also implement self-centered lying (DePaulo 2004), e.g., characters lying about their job titles or relationships with other characters. Finally, we envision characters who discover they have been lied to revising their affinities toward the liars, or even confronting them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research paper also detailed how other video game developers attempted to create lying NPCs, with an emphasis on how their system differs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;TALE-SPIN characters may lie to one another (Meehan 1976, 183-84), though rather arbitrarily, as in our current system implementation. GOLEM implements a blocks world variant in which agents deceive others to achieve goals (Castelfranchi, Falcone, and De Rosis 1998), while Mouth of Truth uses a probabilistic representation of character belief to fuel agent deception in a variant of Turing’s imitation game (De Rosis et al. 2003). In Christian (2004), a deception planner injects inaccurate world state into the beliefs of a target agent so that she may unwittingly carry out actions that fulfill ulterior goals of a deceiving agent. Lastly, agents in Reis’s (2012) extension to FAtiMA employ multiple levels of theory of mind to deceive one another in the party game Werewolf. While all of the above systems showcase characters who perceive—and in some cases, deceive—other characters, none appear to support the following key components of our system: knowledge propagation and memory fallibility. ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Like a few other systems noted above, Dwarf Fortress also features characters who autonomously lie. When a character commits a crime, she may falsely implicate someone else in a witness report to a sheriff, to protect herself or even to frame an enemy. These witness reports, however, are only seen by the player; characters don’t give false witness reports to each other. They may, however, lie about their opinions, for instance, out of fear of repercussions from criticizing a leader. Finally, Dwarf Fortress does not currently model issues of memory fallibility—Adams is wary that such phenomena would appear to arise from bugs if not artfully expressed to the player.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastActivityDate="2016-08-30T23:35:44.273" CommentCount="1" />

Well, if its to shape vector weights, I suspect it too will have to learn those values through statistical iteration and feedback (as opposed to logical induction, say).  I doubt such a mechanism exists yet, since it'd probably resemble NNs in sufficiently many ways that, thus far, it would have seemed too derivative of NNs to gain acceptance as sufficiently novel.  Of course to be as powerful as deep nets, it too would have to propagate learning weights both forward and backward without incurring much error.

Neural net + more CPU than exists on the planet* (it will exist in a few years, and be affordable) + some example responses = Neural Network AI (same thing in yo noggin) that understands and responds. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that isn't necessary.

The AI might offer a gatekeeper a recipe for perfect health, immortality, or whatever the gatekeeper is believed to most desire.'&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'One strategy to attempt to box the AI would be to allow the AI to respond to narrow multiple-choice questions whose answers would benefit human science or medicine, but otherwise bar all other communication with or observation of the AI. A more lenient &quot;informational containment&quot; strategy would restrict the AI to a low-bandwidth text-only interface, which would at least prevent emotive imagery or some kind of hypothetical &quot;hypnotic pattern&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'Note that on a technical level, no system can be completely isolated and still remain useful: even if the operators refrain from allowing the AI to communicate and instead merely run the AI for the purpose of observing its inner dynamics, the AI could strategically alter its dynamics to influence the observers. For example, the AI could choose to creatively malfunction in a way that increases the probability that its operators will become lulled into a false sense of security and choose to reboot and then de-isolate the system.'&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movie Ex Machina demonstrates (SPOILER ALERT SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT AT SOME POINT) how the AI escaped the box by using clever manipulation on Caleb. It could analyse him to find his weaknesses. It exploited him and appealed to his emotional side by convincing him that she &lt;em&gt;liked&lt;/em&gt; him. When she finally has them in checkmate the reality hits him how he was played like a fool as was expected by Nathan. Nathan's reaction to being stabbed by his creation was 'fucking unreal'. That's right, he knew this was a risk and there's a very good reminder in the lack of remorse and genuine emotion in an AI for Ava to actually care. The AI pretended to be human and used their weaknesses in a brilliant and unpredictable way. This film is a good example of how unexpected it was up until the point when it hits Caleb, once it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just remind yourself how easy it is for high IQ people to manipulate low IQ people. Or how an adult could easily play mental tricks/manipulate a child. It's not difficult to fathom the outcome of an AI box but for us, we just wouldn't see it coming until it was too late. Because we just don't have the same level of intelligence and some people don't want to accept that. People want to have faith in humanity's brilliant minds in coming up with ways to prevent this by planning now. In all honesty, it wouldn't make a difference I'm sorry to say the truth.

You could even plug it into ALICE and see&#xA;how long it takes to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; Makes you impervious to any reasoning, which is exactly what you'd want to be in this situation &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; Might be an uncomfortable position for people who don't simply want to win, but rather attach importance to consistent reasoning. Avoids the point that maybe, just maybe there is a good reason to let the AI out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You control the backup system, don't you? Use it to mess with AI's&#xA;memory (or let the AI believe you did it): i.e., you can claim that&#xA;you already tried to release the AI, and it had been&#xA;destroyed/corrupted by a virus, so you had to restore it from a&#xA;backup (you can use it to enforce the &quot;AI destruction&quot; argument)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; It's also the ultimate counter-attack to any memetic threat from the AI: if the AI throw a basilisk, or similar, you can always respond that you already had the same conversation, and the AI already threatened you, leaving you with no other choice than pressing the reset button: now the AI is just repeating the same pattern, since you wiped its memory and it cannot remember the failed try. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Further analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Gatekeeper is human matters; the AI could never win if he/she was arguing with a rock &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In all of the experiments performed so far, the AI player (Eliezer Yudkowsky) has been quite intelligent and more interested in the problem than the Gatekeepers (random people who challenge Yudkowsky), which suggests that intelligence and planning play a role &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There probably isn't a (known) correct argument for letting the AI out, or else Yudkowsky should have won every time and wouldn't be so interested in this experiment&#xA;From Russell Wallace, one of the two Gatekeepers to win the experiment: &quot;Throughout the experiment, I regarded &quot;should the AI be let out of the box?&quot; as a question to be seriously asked; but at no point was I on the verge of doing it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There exists, for everyone, a sentence - a series of words - that has the power to destroy you.

This question is still in great debates, but I will dare offer my own insights:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotions in humans (and animals!) are known to affect memories. They are now well known in neuroscience as additional modalities, or meta-data if you prefer, of long term memories: they allow to modulate how the memory is stored, how it is associated/related with other memories, and how it will be retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, we can hypothesize that the main role of emotions is to add additional meta-information to memories to help in heuristic inference/retrieval. Indeed, our memories are huge, there are a lot of information we store over our lifetime, so emotions can maybe be used as &quot;labels&quot; to help retrieve faster the relevant memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar &quot;labels&quot; can be more easily associated together (memories of scary events together, memories of happy events together, etc.). As such, they can help survival by quickly reacting and applying known strategies (fleeing!) from scary strategies, or to take the most out of benefitting situations (happy events, eat the most you can, will help survive later on!). And actually, neuroscience studies discovered that there are specific pathways for fear-inducing sensory stimuli, so that they reach actuators faster (make you flee) than by passing through the usual whole somato-sensory circuit as every other stimuli. This kind of associative reasoning could also lead to solutions and conclusions that could not be reached otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By feeling empathy, this could ease robots/humans interaction (eg, drones helping victims of catastrophic events).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A virtual model of an AI with emotions could be useful for neuroscience and medical research in emotional disorders as computational models to understand and/or infer the underlying parameters (this is often done for example with Alzheimer and other neurodegenerative diseases, but I'm not sure if it was ever done for emotional disorders as they are quite new in the DSM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yes, &quot;cold&quot; AI is already useful, but emotional AI could surely be applied to new areas that could not be explored by using cold AI alone.

The base idea is to talk about how the function changes in regards to changes in input. So now, we're out of high school and we're building neural nets. We've done the basic coding, and want to look at how our model is working. Back from our statistics class, we remember we use a certain measure of error (e.g. least squares) to determine the efficacy of the models from that class, so we decide to use that here. We get this error, and it's a bit too big for our liking, so we decide to fiddle with our model and adjust the weights to get that error down. But how? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where the 'search' comes into play. It's really a search for the best weights to put on the edges of our net to optimize it. We use the derivative (in some fancy ways, using the 'stochasitc' (think random sampling) and other ways the question mentions) to search for which way is 'down' in the high dimensional space of our weights. In other words, what we are searching for is minima or maxima to optimize our neural net, and we 'search' for it by doing a derivative which tells us which way to go, moving a bit in that direction, then doing that again and again iteratively to find (hopefully) the best weights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This video here goes into all the detail you'd want, and I recommend the entire series as a robust but understandable intro to neural nets: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlcnxUlrtek&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Demystifying Neural Networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go and look up 'gradient descent' to get any related material.

First, what many people refer to as &quot;search&quot; is a reflection of how what we call &quot;intelligence&quot; frequently involves searching something:  a physical realm, a &quot;state space&quot; of possible solutions, a &quot;knowledge space&quot; where ideas/facts/concepts/etc. are related as a graph structure, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look up some old papers on computer chess, and you'll see that a lot of that involves searching a &quot;state space&quot;.  As such, search algorithms that are efficient (in terms of time complexity and/or space complexity) have always been important to making advances there.  And while computer chess is just one example, the principle generalizes to many other kinds of problem solving and goal seeking activities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/mmg/teaching/artificialintelligence/nonflash/problemframenf.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a reference&lt;/a&gt; that explains more about some of these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note too that &quot;search&quot; is closely related to the idea of &quot;heuristics&quot; in an important way.  Many search problems in the real world are far too complex to solve by exhaustive brute-force search, so humans (and AI's) resort to heuristics to narrow the state space being searched.  Using heuristics can yield search algorithms that allow for reasonable solutions in a realistic time-frame, where no simple, deterministic algorithm exists to do likewise.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some more background you might want to read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A* search&lt;/a&gt;, which is a widely used algorithm with many applications - and not just in AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other major regard in which something you could call &quot;search&quot; applies in AI is through the use of algorithms which are also often referred to as &quot;optimisation&quot; techniques.

These are used to maximize or minimize the values of some function  and one of the canonical uses in AI is for training neural networks using back-propagation, where you're trying to minimize the delta between the &quot;correct&quot; answer (from the training data) and the generated answer, so you can learn the correct weights within the network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33" LastEditorUserId="33" LastEditDate="2016-09-08T14:19:26.630" LastActivityDate="2016-09-08T14:19:26.630" CommentCount="9" />

They shouldn't be all in the US - at the time the US will have this fleet, other countries will develop also theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Btw, a world takeover seem to me unreal - the military leaders can maybe switch the human pilots to drones, it is not their job.

It seems clear that analog computers do have certain advantages over digital computers.  For one, they can (depending on the application) be faster, albeit at the cost of some loss of precision.  But that's OK, because I don't think anybody believes the human brain is calculating floating point math using digital computing techniques either.  The human brain appears, at least superficially, to be largely probabilistic and able to tolerate some &quot;slop&quot; numerically.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The downside to analog computers, as I understand it, is that they're not as flexible... you basically hardwire a circuit to do one specific &quot;thing&quot; and that's really all it can do.

AI problems are generally those for which a strong polynomial  algorithm is not known, and thus, we must settle for approximations.  Basically every common problem that the human brain must solve falls into this category.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the problem of moving a multi-jointed robotic arm to pick up an object.  Reverse kinematics does not have unique solutions: there is more than one way to move your hand from a start position to a target position.  This is due to the excessive degrees of freedom in your joints.  If you want to minimize energy usage, then there is a unique solution (due to the asymmetry of joints and muscles).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what if there is an obstacle in the pathway of the minimum-energy solution?  There are many pathways which avoid the obstacle, but again, many of them will have a similar cost.  Even if there is a unique minimum-energy solution, it might not be the most practical to compute.  The brain is the most metabolically expensive organ in the body, so it is not always best to find an optimal solution.  Thus, heuristics come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in all cases, the problem is not: &quot;move your hand&quot; or &quot;move the robot arm.&quot;  The problem is: &quot;search the space of joint rotation sequences which best achieves the goal.&quot;  And even though there is a closed-form solution for the simple minimum-energy case with no obstacles, it is too expensive to compute precisely when a set of cheap heuristics will get you very close with a small fraction of the computational effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If computation were free, then AI would be mere mathematics, and we would always compute the best answer to every question using logic, calculus, physics, at worst, numerical methods when we don't have closed-form solutions.  In reality, time is money, and the time and effort to get an answer is as much a part of the cost as the quality of the solution.  So it is an engineering tradeoff to decide how much effort should be expended in what way to obtain the best answer given the value of the response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, in other words, AI problems are all about searching the space of solutions as quickly as possible to get an answer that is &quot;good enough&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might seem curious that such far-flung problems as natural language recognition and theorem proving would be search problems.  But language parsers strive to determine the meaning of statements via part-of-speech tagging.

I recently did a dissertation on the converse (generating the correct gesture from a specific social context &amp;amp; linguistic cues). The factors that go into the production of a particular gesture include the relationship between the two communicators (especially romantic connotations), the social scenario, the physical context, the linguistic context (the ongoing conversation, if any), a whole lot of personal factors (our gesture use is essentially a hybrid of important individuals around us e.g. friends &amp;amp; family, and this is layered under the individual's psychological state). Then the whole thing is flipped around again when you look at how gestures are used completely differently in different cultures (look up gestures that are swear words in other cultures for an example!). There are a number of models for gesture production but none of them capture the complexity of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, that may seem like a whole lot of fluff that is not wholly relevant to your question, but my point is that ASIMO isn't actually very 'clever' at this. AFAIK (I have heard from a visualization guy that this is how &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; thinks they do it) they use conventional (but optimized) image recognition techniques trained on a corpus of data to achieve recognition of particular movements. One would assume that the dataset consists of a series of videos / images of gestures labelled with that particular gesture (as interpreted by a human), which can then be treated as a machine learning problem. The issue with this is that it does not capture ANY of the issues I mentioned above. Now if we return to the current best interpretation of gesture that we have (that it is essentially auxiliary language in its own right), ASIMO isn't recognizing any element of language beyond the immediately recognizable type, 'Emblems'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'Emblems' are gestures which have a direct verbal translation, for example in English-based cultures, forming a circle with your thumb and index finger translates directly to 'OK'. ASIMO is therefore missing out on a huge part of the non-verbal dictionary (illustrators, affect displays, regulators and adapters are not considered!), and even the part that it is accessing is based on particular individuals' interpretations of said emblems (e.g. someone has sat down and said that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; particular movement is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; gesture which means &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;), which as we discussed before is highly personal and contextual. I do not mean this in criticism of Honda; truth be told, gesture recognition and production is in my opinion one of the most interesting problems in AI (even if its not the most useful) as it is a compound of incredibly complex NLP, visualization and social modelling problems!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I've provided some information on how ASIMO works in this context, but also on why ASIMO's current process is flawed when we look at the wider picture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1467" LastEditorUserId="1467" LastEditDate="2016-09-12T09:43:12.550" LastActivityDate="2016-09-12T09:43:12.550" CommentCount="0" />

The idea of multi-task learning is that a predictor predicting multiple variables (in this case the various Q(s,a1), Q(s,a2), ...) using mostly the same structure (varying only the output weights) will learn more sensible things. Though I admit applying this here might be a bit of a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the real question, a popular technique in Reinforcement Learning is &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node88.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tile Coding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is to discretize the (2-dimensional, in your case) state-space - imagine a grid laid over the 2D space - and assigning an input feature to each cell; all of these variables are set to zero except for the one your continuous variables fall into. For example, if your grid is 20x20, you will have 400 variables, 399 of which are set to zero, and 1 set to one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tile Coding takes this one step further and repeats this using slight offsets for the grid. Imagine you create an identical grid but you move it slightly to the right by 1/10 of the width of a cell: you will have another set of 400 variables like before, but it is possible that the cell set to one is not the same. Then you repeat this moving the grid by 2/10 and you have another set of 400 variables, again, only 1 of which is set to one. In total you have 10 sets of 400 variables (if you repeat more than that, you get the same grids as before); of your 4000 variables, only 10 are set to one.&#xA;Now you repeat this by adding a 1/10 of a cell offset in the Y axis and obtain another 4000 variables. Repeat with 2/10 and you get another 4000. By the end of it, you have 40000 variables, 100 of which are set to one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now your net can more easily learn different weights for different positions. I recommend you to follow the link above for a better explanation than mine (and figures!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My suggestion is to feed all of these variables to your net and have it predict the Q-value for all of the actions.

If it is supposed to solve a single easy task perfectly and professionally, sure emotions would not be very useful. But if it is supposed to learn random new things, there would be a point that it encounters something it cannot handle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Lee Sedol vs AlphaGo match 4, some pro who has said computer doesn't have emotions previously, commented that maybe AlphaGo has emotions too, and stronger than human. In this case, we know that AlphaGo's crazy behavior isn't caused by some deliberately added things called &quot;emotions&quot;, but a flaw in the algorithm. But it behaves exactly like it has panicked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this happens a lot for an AI. There might be advantages if it could know this itself and think twice if it happens. If AlphaGo could detect the problem and change its strategy, it might play better, or worse. It's not unlikely to play worse if it didn't do any computations for other approaches at all. In case it would play worse, we might say it suffers from having &quot;emotions&quot;, and this might be the reason some people think having emotions could be a flaw of human beings. But that wouldn't be the true cause of the problem. The true cause is it just doesn't know any approaches to guarantee winning, and the change in strategy is only a try to fix the problem. Commentators thinks there are better ways (which also don't guarantee winning but had more chance), but its algorithm isn't capable to find out in this situation. Even for human, the solution to anything related to emotion is unlikely to remove emotions, but some training to make sure you understand the situation enough to act calmly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then someone has to argue about whether this is a kind of emotion or not. We usually don't say small insects have human-like emotions, because we don't understand them and are unwilling to help them. But it's easy to know some of them could panic in desperate situations, just like AlphaGo did. I'd say these reactions are based on the same logic, and they are at least the reason why human-like emotions could be potentially useful. They are just not expressed in human-understandable ways, as they didn't intend to call a human for help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they tries to understand their own behavior, or call someone else for help, it might be good to be exactly human-like. Some pets can sense human emotions and express human-understandable emotion to some degree. The purpose is to interact with humans. They evolved to have this ability because they needed it at some point. It's likely a full strong AI would need it too. Also note that, the opposite of having full emotions might be becoming crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is probably a quick way to lose any trust if someone just implement emotions imitating humans with little understanding right away in the first generations, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Weak AIs&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But is there any purposes for them to have emotions before someone wanted a strong AI? I'd say no, there isn't any inherent reasons that they must have emotions. But inevitably someone will want to implement imitated emotions anyway. Whether &quot;we&quot; need them to have emotions is just nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact is even some programs without any intelligence contained some &quot;emotional&quot; elements in their user interfaces. They may look unprofessional, but not every task needs professionality so they could be perfectly acceptable. They are just like the emotions in musics and arts. Someone will design their weak AI in this way too. But they are not really the AIs' emotions, but their creators'. If you feel better or worse because of their emotions, you won't treat individul AIs so differently, but this model or brand as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively someone could plant some personallities like in a role-playing game there. Again, there isn't a reason they must have that, but inevitably someone will do it, because they obviously had some market when a role-playing game does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In either cases, the emotions don't really originate from the AI itself. And it would be easy to implement, because a human won't expect them to be exactly like a human, but tries to understand what they intended to mean. It could be much easier to accept these emotions realizing this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Aspects of emotions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sorry about posting some original research here. I made a list of emotions in 2012 and from which I see 4 aspects of emotions. If they are all implemented, I'd say they are exactly the same emotions as of humans. They don't seem real if only some of them are implemented, but that doesn't mean they are completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The reason, or the original logical problem that the AI cannot solve. AlphaGo already had the reason, but nothing else. If I have to make an accurate definition, I'd say it's the state that multiple equally important heuristics disagreeing with each other.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The context, or which part of the current approach is considered not working well and should probably be replaced. This distinguishes sadness-related, worry-related and passionate-related.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The current state, or whether it feels leading, or whether its belief or the fact is supposed to turn bad first (or was bad all along) if things go wrong. This distinguishes sadness-related, love-related and proud-related.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The plan or request. I suppose some domesticated pets already had this. And I suppose these had some fixed patterns which is not too difficult to have. Even arts can contain them easily. Unlike the reasons, these are not likely inherent in any algorithms, and multiple of them can appear together.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Who supposedly had the responsibility if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes curiosity, rage and sadness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is the supposed plan if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes disappointment, sadness and surprise.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The source. Without context, even a human cannot reliably tell someone is crying for being moved or thankful, or smiling for some kind of embarrassment. In most other cases there aren't even words describing them. It doesn't make that much difference if an AI doesn't distinguish or show this specially. It's likely they would learn these automatically (and inaccurately as a human) at the point they could learn to understand human languages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The measurements, such as how urgent or important the problem is, or even how likely the emotions are true. I'd say it cannot be implemented in the AI. Humans don't need to respect them even if they are exactly like humans. But humans will learn how to understand an AI if that really matters, even if they are not like humans at all. In fact, I feel that some of the extremely weak emotions (such as thinking something is too stupid and boring that you don't know how to comment) exist almost exclusively in emoticons, where someone intend to show you exactly this emotion, and hardly noticeable in real life or any complex scenerios. I supposed this could also be the case in the beginning for AIs. In the worst case, they are firstly conventionally known as &quot;emotions&quot; since emoticons works in these cases, so it's easier to group them together, but very few people seriously think they are, just like the example I gave.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when strong AIs become possible, none of these would be unreachable, though there might be a lot of work to make the connections. So I'd say if there would be the need for strong AIs, they absolutely would have emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1424" LastActivityDate="2016-09-09T22:33:33.240" CommentCount="0" />

Yes, you can find instances of geniuses like Ramanujan solving complex problem during or after a dream state, but those involve partial consciousness. You don't see guys like Einstein coming up with the theory of relativity while in a coma; the Founding Fathers didn't write the Declaration of Independence while sleep-walking; in fact, you can't even find instances of housewives putting together their shopping list for the week during deep delta-wave sleep. This is predicated on a hard definition of intelligence, requiring the use of reason; no one says, &quot;That fly is intelligent&quot; or &quot;that squirrel is intelligent&quot; precisely because neither is capable of using reason. This is a very high bar for A.I., but it is the common sense definition used by ordinary people as a matter of practicality, in everyday speech.  Likewise, in practice, everyone assumes consciousness is necessary to the exercise of that kind of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, we can come up with another common-sense based criterion for judging objections to this argument, particularly the solipsist one, based on 3 elements: 1) practicality; 2) the effect the objections have on those who hold them sincerely; and 3) the effect that actions based on those beliefs have on others. &lt;strong&gt;It's going to take me several paragraphs to make this case, but the length is necessary if I want to make the case in a complete, thorough fashion&lt;/strong&gt;. It is true that we cannot prove that another human being possesses consciousness, if our standard is absolute proof. We cannot, in fact, provide absolute proof for anything; there's always room for some objection, no matter how ridiculous or trifling. As some philosophers have pointed out, perhaps all of reality as we know it is just a dream, or the product of some long, involved conspiracy like the plot of the Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show. The key to meeting such objections is that they require an infinite regress of increasingly untenable objections, whose likelihood plunges with each additional step required to justify such unreasonable doubts; I've always wondered if we could come up with a &quot;Ridiculousness Metric&quot; for Machine Learning based on the cardinality of such objections (or the pickiness of fuzzy sets). If we were to allow critics to stick their foot in the door with all manner of unreasonable objections, it would be impossible to close any debate. The human race would be paralyzed in inaction because nothing would be decidable; but as the rock band Rush once pointed out, &quot;If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.&quot; At some point we must apply a test to decide such things, even in the absence of absolute proof; refusal to apply a test also constitutes a choice. Settling an argument of this kind is like a game  of the Chinese game Go - once the other player's surrounded and has no more moves left to make, the game is over; if a person's evidence has debunked and they have no further justifications left, then we can conclude that they're acting unreasonably. There are people running around claiming the Holocaust never happened, or the Flat Earth Society, etc., but their existence shouldn't and doesn't stop us from taking action contrary to their ideas. We can debunk the objections of cranks like the Flat Earth Society beyond a reasonable doubt because in the end, they simply can't answer all of our rebuttals. I’m glad that qualia and Philosophical Zombies were brought up because they make for interesting conversation and food for thought, but solipsism is acted upon as rarely as the ideas of the Flat Earth Society precisely because the incomplete evidence we &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; have runs against it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As G.K. Chesterton (a.k.a. &quot;The Apostle of Common Sense&quot;) points out in his classic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;, radical doubt of the kind many classical philosophers preached is not a path to wisdom but to madness; once we go beyond a reasonable doubt, we end up acting unreasonably. He says that in the absence of absolute proof we can fall back on another secondary form of evidence: whether a person's philosophy leads a man to Hanwell, the infamous British mental institution. Chesterton makes a good case that when people actually act on ideas like solipsism (rather than merely debating them in a pedantic manner in an ivy-covered classroom) they go mad The Philosophical Zombie argument is close to solipsism, which is actually one of the diagnostic criteria for certain forms of schizophrenia. The dehumanization that occurs when radical doubt is applied to qualia is also intimately tied in with sociopathic behavior, Although GKC does not cite his scary example directly, Rene Descartes was himself living proof. He was a brilliant mathematician who is still cheered for doubting all except his own existence, with the famous maxim &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; But Descartes also used to carry a mannequin of his dead sister with him to European cafes, where he could be seen chatting with it. The gist of all this is that we can judge the worth of an idea by how it affects the well-being of the believer, or by how they in turn affect others through ethical choices based on those beliefs. When people actually act on radical doubt of the kind expressed in solipsism and denial of common qualia, it often has a bad effect on them and others they come in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a roundabout way, the A.I. community also faces a quite serious risk - perhaps a permanent temptation - towards making the opposite mistake, of ascribing common qualia, consciousness and the like to its Machine Learning products without adequate proof. I recently heard a case made on shockingly bad logical grounds by well-respected academics to the effect that plants possess &quot;intelligence,&quot; based on really weak definitions and clear confusion with self-organization. We cannot provide absolute proof that a rock doesn't have intelligence, which amounts to the old problem of disproving a negative. Thankfully, few men actually act on such beliefs at present, because when they do, they end up losing their minds. If we take such arguments seriously, we might see laws passed to protect the kind of Pet Rocks that were popular in the '70s (I'm still upset that mine was stolen LOL). It would be a lot easier, however, to make the same mistake of ascribing consciousness, intelligence and other such qualities to a state-of-the-art machine, because of wishful thinking, hubris, the lofty credentials of the inventors, the influence of science fiction and the modern love affair with technology. In the future, I have little doubt that we'll have Cargo Cult of A.I. - perhaps legally protected like some kind of endangered species, with civil rights, but having no more consciousness, soul or actual intelligence than a rock. Don't quote me on this, but I believe Rod Serling once wrote a story to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid this fate is to stick to the common sense interpretations and definitions of these things, which we keep backing away from in large part because they set a very high bar for A.I. that we may never be able to surpass in our lifetimes, if ever. Perhaps A.I. isn't even logically possible, at any level of technology; I recall a few proofs that can be interpreted to that effect. Those high but reasonable standards may be increasingly difficult to stick to if Chesterton and colleagues like Hilaire Belloc and Arnold Lunn were correct in their assessment that the use of reason has actually been breaking down in Western civilization, at least as far back as the Enlightenment; Lunn's 1931 book The Flight from Reason is a classic in this regard and has yet to be rebutted.  This historical trend is a broad topic in and of itself - but suffice it to say that the denial of reason and obsession with technology are both directly relevant in obvious ways to the field of A.I. If the Flight from Reason is still under way, then we will be increasingly tempted to resort to feckless, facile objections in order to demote the use of reason and indispensable qualities like consciousness in our definitions of A.I., but come up with increasingly weak criteria for proving it; simultaneously, our technology will continue to improve, thereby boosting the &quot;Artificial&quot; side of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong: if I didn't think we can do some really exciting things with A.I., I wouldn't be here. But most of them can be achieved without ever replicating actual human intelligence, by solving whole classes of tangential problems that are difficult for humans to think about, but which do not require consciousness or the use of reason that marks human intelligence. The image recognition capabilities of convolutional neural nets are one example, for instance; if we want human intelligence, we can always manufacture it through the easiest, most economical and time-tested way, by having babies. Perhaps these tangential forms of A.I. should be enough for us for now. We cannot inject the use of reason into our machines if we do not possess enough of it ourselves to decide whether reason is necessary for A.I., or even to discern what it consists of. We can't engineer or deprecate consciousness for A.I. till we're conscious of its significance. I'd wager, however, that everyone reading this thread and weighing intelligent responses is doing so in a conscious state. That in and of itself ought to answer our question satisfactorily for now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1427" LastActivityDate="2016-09-09T23:18:10.873" CommentCount="0" />

There may be only one scenario: Global destruction: Extreme scenario where everything supporting the existence of an AI disappears. This is equivalent to death in natural life, and low probability. It means all AIs die at once (as well as us).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also do not know the degree and form of embodiment necessary for AGIs. We can &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; now that hardware is replaceable indefinitely, thus &quot;limiting&quot; death to the above extreme scenario.

Then a definition closer to natural life death may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We see arguments for two other scenarios, that I &lt;em&gt;refute&lt;/em&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Static Death&quot;: An AI is still &quot;defined&quot; or &quot;saved&quot; somewhere (whatever it means actually), but it is not authorized or able to use resources. Assuming an AI is made of hardware and software, it is like a program stored on a disk, but without permission to run. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dynamic Death&quot;: Under the same characterization of AI as hardware and software, dynamic death is the invalidation of progress akin to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;strong liveness properties&lt;/a&gt;, where an AI is trapped in an infinite loop (or a void loop), in a form of &quot;active death&quot;, as what happens to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt; in Greek mythology. This is different from static death, as the AI &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; uses dynamic resources, although it cannot make progress. Continuing under the same assumptions, such AI could be &quot;loaded&quot; in main memory, or locked waiting for inputs or outputs to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in these two scenarios, &lt;em&gt;rebirth&lt;/em&gt; is possible, and they also subsume that there is an entity that can &lt;em&gt;decide&lt;/em&gt; conditions for rebirth, or preventing it completely. Would this entity be an &quot;admin&quot;, a god, other AIs, or a human is another question, really.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The terms &quot;death&quot; and &quot;rebirth&quot; here could just be changed for &quot;imprisoning&quot;, where the dynamic version would be like our human prisons, and the static version would be like SciFi cryogeny. This is a bit of a stretch, but we can see an equivalence, and no good reason to qualify these two scenarios as deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, death for AI seems to be an exceptional, singular scenario, so AI cannot die &lt;em&gt;in practice&lt;/em&gt;, except if we are wrong on how we think we can make AGIs.

Of course, it may be the case that a combination of one or more types of these continuity is required for you to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other answers assumes that life is based on &quot;psychological continuity&quot;, and looks at what might disrupt this &quot;continuity&quot;.

By playing through &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Staying Alive&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, you will be able to work out your own personal definition of life and death. Once you have your own personal definition, then simply apply it to this specific case, either siding with &quot;psychological continuity&quot; (the other answers) or &quot;bodily continuity&quot; (my own opinion).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;*If you assume that life requires a soul, well, it is not clear that AI would have souls.

If they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have souls though, then the other answers which assume &quot;psychological continuity&quot; may still be applicable, as it seems that the existence of a &quot;soul&quot; is dependent on &quot;psychological continuity&quot;.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastEditorUserId="181" LastEditDate="2016-09-11T17:31:16.407" LastActivityDate="2016-09-11T17:31:16.407" CommentCount="2" />

This includes variants like Bidirectional, Jordan and Elman Networks. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a more sophisticated neural net algorithm which can accomplish the same time and sequence-based tasks, but which can leverage standard learning methods like backprop since it doesn't suffer from the &quot;vanishing gradient problem.&quot; This is because LSTMs have been brilliantly engineered as &quot;perfect integrators,&quot; which makes it a lot easier to calculate the error gradients etc. over long periods of time. In contrast, learning with RNNs is still not theoretically well-grounded and is difficult to calculate through existing methods like Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). In Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs), the idea is to add new neurons and connections with each new training example across a stretch of time or training sequence; unfortunately, this places a practical limitation on how many examples you can feed into the net before the size of the network gets out of hand or it starts forgetting, just as with RNNs. LSTMs have much longer memories (especially when augmented with Neural Turing Machines) so that'd be my first choice, assuming I wanted to use neural nets for NLP purposes. My knowledge of the subject is limited though (I'm still trying to learn the ropes) so there may be other important neural net algorithms I'm overlooking...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1427" LastActivityDate="2016-09-18T16:50:48.577" CommentCount="0" />

I still am, despite the fact that I have a few reservations about some of his philosophical musings on the meanings of consciousness, free will and other such topics. I won't elaborate on those misgivings here because they're not germane to the main, overwhelming reason why HTM nets haven't succeeded as much as expected to date: to my knowledge, Numenta has only implemented a truncated version of his vision. They left out most of the prediction architecture, which plays such a critical role in Hawkins' theories. As Gerod M. Bonhoff put it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf&quot;&gt;an excellent thesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; on HTMs, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In March of 2007, Numenta released what they claimed was a “research&#xA;  implementation” of HTM theory called Numenta Platform for Intelligent&#xA;  Computing (NuPIC). The algorithm used by NuPIC at this time is called&#xA;  “Zeta1.” NuPIC was released as an open source software platform and&#xA;  binary files of the Zeta1 algorithm. Because of licensing, this paper&#xA;  is not allowed to discuss the proprietary implementation aspects of&#xA;  Numenta’s Zeta1 algorithm. There are, however, generalized&#xA;  concepts of implementation that can be discussed freely. The two most&#xA;  important of these are how the Zeta 1 algorithm (encapsulated in each&#xA;  memory node of the network hierarchy) implements HTM theory. To&#xA;  implement any theory in software, an algorithmic design for each&#xA;  aspect of the theory must be addressed. The most important design&#xA;  decision Numenta adopted was to eliminate feedback within the&#xA;  hierarchy and instead choose to simulate this theoretical concept&#xA;  using only data pooling algorithms for weighting. This decision is&#xA;  immediately suspect and violates key concepts of HTM. Feedback,&#xA;  Hawkins’ insists, is vital to cortical function and central to his&#xA;  theories. Still, Numenta claims that most HTM applicable problems can&#xA;  be solved using their implementation and proprietary pooling&#xA;  algorithms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am still learning the ropes in this field and cannot say whether or not Numenta has since scrapped this approach in favor of a full implementation of Hawkins' ideas, especially the all-important prediction architecture. Even if they have, this design decision has probably delayed adoption by many years. That's not a criticism per se; perhaps the computational costs of tracking prediction values and updating them on the fly were too much to bear at the time, on top of the ordinary costs of processing neural nets, leaving them with no other path except to try half-measures like their proprietary pooling mechanisms. Nevertheless, all of the best research papers I've read on the topic since then have chosen to reimplement the algorithms rather than relying on Numenta's platform, typically because of the missing prediction features. Cases in point include Bonhoff's thesis and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cogprints.org/9187/1/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf&quot;&gt;Maltoni's technical report for the University of Bologna Biometric System Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cogprints.org/9187/1/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. In all of those cases, however, there is no readily accessible software for putting their variant HTMs to immediate use (as far as I know). The gist of all this is that like G.K. Chesterton's famous maxim about Christianity, &quot;HTMs have not been tried and found wanting; they have been found difficult, and left untried.&quot; Since Numenta left out the prediction steps, I assume that they would be the main stumbling blocks awaiting anyone who wants to code Hawkins' full vision of what an HTM should be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;Bonhoff, Gerod M., 2008, Using Hierarchical Temporal Memory for Detecting Anomalous Network Activity.

This is basically a form of preprocessing in which a text is recursively reduced to a smaller number of word vectors until only one is left - your input, which is supposed to encode the whole text. This makes a lot of sense from a linguistic point of view if your input consists of sentences (which can vary a lot in size), because sentences are structured recursively (For example the word vector for &quot;the man&quot;, should be similar to the word vector for &quot;the man who mistook his wife for a hat&quot;, because noun phrases act like nouns etc.).

In linear programming, at least one vertex of the feasible solution space will be optimal, and so simple solution methods find an optimal vertex (which is almost infeasible by nature of being a vertex).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As another example, the minimum-fuel solution for moving a spacecraft from one position to another is called '&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control&quot;&gt;bang-bang&lt;/a&gt;,' where you accelerate the craft as quickly as possible at the beginning and end of the trajectory, coasting at maximum speed in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While a virtue when the system is correctly understood (bang-bang &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; optimal for many cases), this is catastrophic when the system is incorrectly understood. My favorite example here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d1/teaching/ws14/Ideen-der-Informatik/Dantzig-Diet.pdf&quot;&gt;Dantzig's diet problem&lt;/a&gt; (discussion starts on page 5 of the pdf), where he tries to optimize his diet using math. Under his first constraint set, he's supposed to drink 500 gallons of vinegar a day. Under his second, 200 bouillon cubes. Under his third, two pounds of bran. The considerations that make those obviously bad ideas aren't baked into the system, and so the system innocently suggests them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can completely encode the knowledge and values that a person uses to judge these plans into the AI, then extrapolative systems are as safe as that person. They'll be able to consider and reject the wrong sort of extreme plans, and leave you with the right sort of extreme plans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if you can't, then it does make sense to not build an extrapolative decision-maker, and instead build an interpolative one. That is, instead of asking itself &quot;how do I best accomplish goal X?&quot; it's asking itself &quot;what would a person do in this situation?&quot;. The latter might be much worse at accomplishing goal X, but it has much less of the tail risk of sacrificing other goals to accomplish X.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastEditorUserId="10" LastEditDate="2016-09-27T19:32:53.843" LastActivityDate="2016-09-27T19:32:53.843" CommentCount="0" />

The travel may take days -&#xA;  of real time too, so the path must be saved to disk, and the space in&#xA;  the save file for custom data like this is severely limited.

The No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem states essentially that: &lt;em&gt;any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.&lt;/em&gt; Specialization implies a &lt;em&gt;loss&lt;/em&gt; of generality, not a &lt;em&gt;gain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this AI generating AI, you're describing what I call an 'arbitrary machine generator' (AMG).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of AMGs: a species level and an individual level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All species that evolve on earth are AMG - they can evolve to accommodate arbitrary niches, if the correct environmental constraints are present. This is proven by the fact that the species AMG processes on earth have produce humans, which are individual level AMGs. Individual level AMGs can produce arbitrary machines for arbitrary purposes on human time-scales.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the simplest possible (and most general) AMG is a purely &lt;em&gt;random&lt;/em&gt; machine generator. Any more specificity (and therefore complexity) to the AMG would constrain the domains it closes over. Which is fine, but optimizing a machine for a particular set of tasks means that you are &lt;em&gt;unoptimizing&lt;/em&gt; the machine for some other particular set of tasks. Again, there's no free context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humans are AMGs, but we are only efficient at creating certain kinds of machines, using our imagination. Our imagination is built on a number of cognitive tools that, on the one hand, constrain what machines we can efficiently imagine, while, on the other hand, avail us to the open-ended set of all possible machines, via prior knowledge or brute force, random lookup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, when people say &lt;em&gt;&quot;general intelligence&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, they really mean &lt;em&gt;&quot;human-like intelligence&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. And, again, while human intelligence &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an AMG, any given AMG that is optimized for generating machines of a particular type will be less optimized for generating machines of some other type(s). There's no free context. The most general search algorithm is a random walk - there is no way to &lt;em&gt;improve&lt;/em&gt; the generality of the random walk, other than just speeding it up. And that's actually what humans do for many problems anyway - brute force, random searching, as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1712" LastActivityDate="2016-09-30T17:24:55.247" CommentCount="0" />

Technology can change and adapt, and humans can also change and adapt. Maybe a human might not care about a shrink who &quot;rubs its eyes in the morning&quot;, dislike movies that are marred by that &quot;vagaries of humanity&quot; instead of personal customization, prefer politicians and soldiers that actually acts logically instead of acting like a falliable human, etc., etc. I mean, it's &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the problem of the term &quot;job&quot;. Technically, I am working by writing an answer on a StackExchange website, but I'm not getting paid for it, so it's not a real &quot;job&quot;...at best, it's just a hobby. I'm providing a valuable human touch, but since no one is giving me money, it's possible that this human touch may not be all that valuable in the first place: &quot;never give out your labor for free, because then they'll take it for free&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the techno-utopists (which I disagree with heavily) believes in a future where bots handle produce a lot of industrial goods and services, generating a lot of revenue that is then redistributed to the general population via some &quot;Basic Income&quot; scheme. This allows humans to do what they really want instead...such as hobbies? And what if the hobbies of the future are the &quot;jobs&quot; of today: shrinks, movie directors, politicians, soldiers, etc., etc. Instead of working for a paycheck, you're working in these jobs on a volunteer basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, no automation is being necessary to eliminate these hobbyists (no matter how good a bot is, &lt;em&gt;free labor&lt;/em&gt; will always prevail), but they're not really jobs, are they? The bot is the one that is producing real value, and subsidizing the hobbies of all these other people. The idea of a &quot;job&quot; itself could be in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think this scenario is likely either (in fact, I'd probably think it's just AI snake oil that will never actually happen). But it's &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; and that's why I can't dismiss it outright. It could happen, just that I don't think it will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, the question is asking about whether a job can be automated, not &lt;em&gt;whether it's a good idea&lt;/em&gt; to have it be automated, which is a completely different question.

I want to make an alternate argument, where the humans are making a mistake, but not in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following situation. I want to build a machine that can do X (where X is some trait, like intelligence). I am able to evaluate intuitively whether a machine has that X criteria. But I don't have a good definition of what X actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. All I can do is identify whether something has X or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I think that people who has X can do Y. So if I build a machine that can do Y, then surely, I built a machine that has X.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After building the machine that can do Y, I examine it to see if my machine has X. And it does not. So my machine lacks X. And while a machine that can do Y is cool, what I really want is a machine that has X. I go back to the drawing board and think of a new idea to reach X.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After writing on the whiteboard for a couple of hours, I realize that people who has X can do Z. Of course! I try to build a new machine that can do Z, yes, if it can do Z, then it must have X.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After building the machine that can do Z, I check to see if it has X. It does not.

Anna Jordanous still remained interested in evaluating creativity tests, publishing articles such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/34328583/Stepping_Back_to_Progress_Forwards-_Setting_Standards_for_Meta-Evaluation_of_Computational_Creativity.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;amp;Expires=1475893195&amp;amp;Signature=ox0%2FOEkNUNjz5pQg0w%2FOgzHPCsM%3D&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DStepping_Back_to_Progress_Forwards_Setti.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Stepping Back to Progress Forwards: Setting Standards for Meta-Evaluation of Computational Creativity&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~map01mm/CC2015/AISB-CC2015-Proceedings.pdf#page=18&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Four PPPPerspectives on Computational Creativity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Evaluating Evaluation&quot; does provide some commentary to explain the proliferation of systems to evaluate creativity:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Evaluation standards are not easy to define.

Unfortunately, current data analysis approaches fail to capture the complex relationship between disease and the vast amount of information in the molecular data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aim of my research is to resolve this challenge with other professional researchers by developing machine learning algorithms that jointly model sophisticated interactions among many variables such as genetic variation, genes, pathways and disease, and robustly learn from vast amounts of data in order to better understand and treat disease.

The definition of life in biological terms is the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic matter where the distinguishing criteria are the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death. Does artificial intelligence &quot;grow&quot;?  Indeed, I can program a machine learning program to grow with every input taken in.  In the loosest sense, we can say that artificial intelligence does grow, but does it biologically? If we look at the definition for growth of a living thing, it means to undergo natural development by increasing in size and changing physically or the progress to maturity.  All living organisms undergo growth.   Even though at the simplest level, cells are a series of chemical processes, cells are a very complicated set of chemical processes that are still not fully understood by scientists across the world.  Every cell has genetic material that can be replicated, excised, used for RNA, proteins, and that is subject to epigenetic regulation. &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cell division&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does artificial intelligence undergo the same process of cell division?  No.  If I wanted to, I could write a program that undergoes a simple for-loop (print i from 1 to 100), replicates itself at a certain point (i=50) to produce the same program perhaps with some variation that will execute itself, and terminates (dies) at the end of the for loop.  The program, by an extremely loose definition supported by philosophy but not by biology, lives.  However, in scientific terms (and the correct interpretation), artificial intelligence is not living.  Artificial intelligence can be seen to be similar to viruses which are considered to be acellular and essential to life but not living.  Viruses are encapsulated DNA and RNA that undergo processes of growth, reproduction, and functionality but because they lack the ability to undergo the cell division cycle, are considered non-living.  At the very basis of the scientific definition of life is the cell replication cycle.  Artificial intelligence and viruses are not able to undergo the cell cycle.  Viruses need to infect other cells in order to reproduce but do not have their own, autonomous cycle.  At the end of the day, if you can argue that viruses are alive, you can argue that artificial intelligence is alive as well.  For the scientific definition of life, artificial intelligence must undergo the process of cell division and replication.

Basically when the pattern recognition says that it doesn't exist in the output scope. (so a final output node group that says this is nothing that I know off). For example, people do this as well, as it's one thing humans and learning algorithms have in common. Here's a link to show what I'm talking about (what is the following, define it) using only known animals that exist:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZwnpm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture link&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now as a person, limited by what I know and can say, I'd have to conclude that the following is an elephant. But it's not. Learning algorithms (for the most part) do not have a &quot;like a&quot; statement, the out put always validates down to a confidence percentage. So tricking one in this fashion is not surprising... what is of course surprising is that based on it's knowledge set, it actually comes to the point in which, if you look at the above cases listed by OP and Vishnu that a person... with a little looking... can see how the learning algorithm probable made the association. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I wouldn't really call it a mislabel on the part of the algorithm, or even call it a case where it's been tricked... rather a case where it's scope was developed incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2246" LastEditorUserId="8" LastEditDate="2016-10-14T17:31:31.923" LastActivityDate="2016-10-14T17:31:31.923" CommentCount="0" />

All examples above are based on convolutional nets (image recognition) and some other assumptions, which might not be applicable in my scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can you give me hints or futher articles, which deal with my questions below? As a beginner, I do not have an overview, yet. Preferably, your suggestions should also be connected to the following areas already: deep learning, reinforcement learning (, multiagent systems)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a card game and the AI shall play a card from its hand, you could think about the cards (amongst other stuff) as the current game state. You can easily define some sort of neural net and feed it with the card data. In a trivial case the cards are just numbered. I do not know the net type, which would be suitable, but I guess deep reinforcment learning strategies could be applied easily then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I can only imagine this, if there is a constant number of hand cards. In the examples above, the number of pixels is also constant, for example. What if a player can have a different numbers of cards? What to do, if a player can have an infinite number of cards? Of course, this is just a theoretical question as no game has an infinite number of cards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the initial examples, the action space is constant. What can you do, if the action space is not? This more or less follows from my previous problem. If you have 3 cards, you can play card 1, 2 or 3. If you have 5 cards, you can play card 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, etc. It is also common in card games, that it is not allowed to play a card.

Keep in mind that this only answers the part of the question pertaining to NTMs, not Google DeepMind itself, plus I'm still learning the ropes in machine learning, so some of the material in these papers is over my head; I did manage to grasp much of the material in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401.pdf&quot;&gt;Graves et al.'s original paper&lt;/a&gt;{1] though and am close to having homegrown NTM code to test. I also at least skimmed the following papers over the last few months; they do not replicate the NTM study in a strict scientific manner, but many of their experimental results do tend to support the original at least tangentially:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• In &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00036.pdf&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; on a variant version of NTM addressing, Gulcehere, et al. do not try to precisely replicate Graves et al.'s tests, but like the DeepMind team, it does demonstrate markedly better results for the original NTM and several variants over an ordinary recurrent LSTM. They use 10,000 training samples of a Facebook Q&amp;amp;A dataset, rather than the N-grams Graves et al. operated on in their paper, so it's not replication in the strictest sense. They did however manage to get a version of the original NTM and several variants up and running, plus recorded the same magnitude of performance improvement.&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00036.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• Unlike the original NTM, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; tested a version of reinforcement learning which was not differentiable; that may be why they were unable to solve several of the programming-like tasts, like Repeat-Copy, unless the controller wasn't confined to moving forwards. Their results were nevertheless good enough to lend support to the idea of NTMs. A more recent revision of their paper is apparently available, which I have yet to read, so perhaps some of their variant's problems have been solved.&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• Instead of testing the original flavor of NTM against ordinary neural nets like LSTMs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03931v3.pdf&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; pitted it against several more advanced NTM memory structures. They got good results on the same type of programming-like tasks that Graves et al. tested, but I don't think they were using the same dataset (it's hard to tell from the way their study is written just what datasets they were operating on).&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03931v3.pdf&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• On p. 8 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065.pdf&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;, an NTM clearly outperforms several LSTM, feed-forward and nearest-neighbor based schemes on an Omniglot character recognition dataset. An alternative approach to external memory cooked up by the authors clearly beats it, but it still obviously performs well. The authors seem to belong to a rival team at Google, so that might be an issue when assessing replicability.&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065.pdf&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• On p. 2 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/ram/papers/paper_6.pdf&quot;&gt;these authors&lt;/a&gt; reported getting better generalization on &quot;very large sequences&quot; in a test of copy tasks, using a much smaller NTM network they evolved with the genetic NEAT algorithm, which dynamically grows topologies.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/ram/papers/paper_6.pdf&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NTMs are fairly new so there hasn't been much time to stringently replicate the original research yet, I suppose. The handful of papers I skimmed over the summer, however, seem to lend support to their experimental results; I have yet to see any that report anything but excellent performance. Of course I have an availability bias, since I only read the pdfs I could easily find in a careless Internet search. From that small sample it seems that most of the follow-up research has been focused on extending the concept, not replication, which would explain the lack of replicability data.

It can change with time, reference to topic of discussion or something else. Today, one parameter to its definition is &lt;em&gt;mortality&lt;/em&gt;. In future if we reach to a certain technological level where mortal beings were only part of history, then the definition will drop &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; parameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Coming to the second question. AI started as field of study to make machines to think like humans (or take rational decisions). Giving life to machines was, or is, not a concern of AI developers (at-least not nowadays). Once I watched some videos of Michio Kaku, where he talked about consciousness along with AI.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Suppose human has a conscious level of 10. Then a thermostat might have the conscious level of 1 as it can sense when the surrounding is hot or cold and then take decision. Similarly a rat can have a conscious level 7 (or something). And the levels are of exponential order (not a linear scale). Similarly you can develop an AI program and check what level of consciousness it has achieved. Then you can decide whether it is living or not. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) will have a lower level of consciousness level than AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) will have consciousness level higher than the other two, and way higher than any human being.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To judge whether an AI program is living or not you need a concrete definition of &lt;strong&gt;&quot;LIFE&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. Your definition can include various parameters like consciousness, adaptability, metabolism (or another method of generating energy for use), rational behavior, intelligence , learning through experience, etc. etc. etc.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But the thing in the end is that its your definition.

If you ask why that makes them powerful, well, that's just the structure of the world. If you are stalked by a wolf, it's not like its upper jaw will attack you frontally, while his lower jaw will attack you from behind. If you want to respond to the threat with a feasible computational effort, you'll have to treat the wolf as one entity. Providing these kinds of entities or concepts from the raw bits and bytes of input is what a hierarchical representation does. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this is quite intuitive for sensory information: lashes, iris, eyebrow make up an eye, eyes, nose and mouth make up a face and so on. What is less obvious, is the fact that motor control works exactly the same way! Only in reverse. If you want to lift your arm, you'll just lift it. But for your brain to actually realise this move, the high level command has to be broken down into precise signals for every muscle involved. And this is done by propagating the command down the hierarchy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the brain these two functions are strongly intertwined. You use constant sensory feedback to adapt your motor control and in many cases you'd be incapable of integrating your stream of sensory data into a coherent representation if you didn't have the additional information of what your body is doing to change that stream of data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Saccades&lt;/a&gt; are a good example for that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course this doesn't mean that our cognitive functions are dependent on the processing of sensorimotor information. I would be surprised if a pure thinking machine wouldn't be possible. There is however a specific version of this &quot;embodied intelligence hypothesis&quot; that sounds plausible to me: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Creating high level cognitive concepts with unsupervised learning is a really difficult problem. Creating high level motor representation might be significantly easier. The reason is that there is more immediate useful feedback. I have been thinking about how to provide a scaffolding for the learning of a hierarchy of cognitive concepts and one thing I could imagine is that high level cognitive concepts basically hitch a ride with the motor concepts. Just think of what a pantomime can express with movement alone. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2227" LastActivityDate="2016-10-31T13:47:58.610" CommentCount="3" />

If having one light-sensitive cell connected to one muscle cell makes an organism more likely to survive, then you have the building blocks to add a second layer without inventing any new sorts of cells, because you already have the information-processing connector.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are convenient for evolution because their organization matches the hierarchical nature of the problem &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the same kind of cell is used everywhere. All you need is dendrites to receive signals, a way to compute the threshold and trigger if the received signal is higher, axons that can make it to other cells, and then branches at the end of the axon to serve as multipliers. You can arbitrarily extend the depth and breadth of the network just by adding more cells.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are convenient for artificial sensorimotor control because they give you, in memory, access to lots of intermediate values. They're also convenient for the same reasons evolution found them convenient--we can just say what we expect the structure of the robotic control will look like, provide training data, and then eventually have a robot that works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there's lots of robotics where the control system is designed instead of learned. To take a very simple example, one &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; use machine learning on the thermostat problem, to learn what temperatures require the heater to be turned on and what temperatures require the air conditioner to be turned on. But this would be extra work &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a less robust system than just designing the optimal control system ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In control theory, there's a concept called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;adaptive control&lt;/a&gt;, where one of the state space parameters for the control system is a property of the system. For example, imagine a satellite; typically we think of the state space of the system as the position and velocity of the satellite in three dimensions, so six total coordinates. There's then a set of differential equations that describe how the satellite will move over time, and what would happen if we used the actuators on the satellite to change its velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But part of those differential equations is the inertia of the satellite. That is, how much fuel we need to expend and how it'll affect the rotation and translation of the satellite depends on where the weight of the satellite is located. And this can change over time, as fuel is consumed or if it wasn't correctly measured to begin with. Adaptive control adds new states to the system to track the inertia, and then simultaneously updates its estimate of the inertia and uses that estimate to plan what controls are necessary to move to a desired position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could imagine solving this problem with neural networks, but we can fairly easily calculate the optimal solution from first principles. In that case, we don't need neural network-based control, but the end result will look something like it from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastActivityDate="2016-10-31T17:32:53.907" CommentCount="8" />

They evolve with time and their evolution is the reason that species are able to survive even when their surroundings experience tragic changes. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;We are on the edge of a breakthrough where software will be able to do the same (evolving by themselves) efficiently. Today this is done one a basic level. Artificial Neural Network is a good example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It is predicted that we will be able to reverse engineer human brain by 2029. Prior to this we will be able to write codes that can stimulate human brain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI programs can be categorized into three:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): This is a basic AI program that is good at good one thing. These programs are prominent nowadays. AI programs playing board games (like Chess, Reversi etc.) are example of these. They are good in only one thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): This is level 2 AI. This will be having a IQ level equivalent of humans. It will be able to do multiple tasks efficiently just like humans. This is where a program can have understanding of it's environment just like humans. Perception, rational behavior and others will be part of this program.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI): This is basically the ultimate level of AI. Average predicted date for a successful ASI is between 2045-2080. Ability of this program will be way more than that of combined intelligence of all humans on the planet. Things this program can do and think, will be beyond any (or all) human(s) to understand or comprehend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3005" LastActivityDate="2016-11-05T05:21:37.280" CommentCount="0" />

An so we consult the grammar rule book, and settle for the meaning ( indefinite article any one of ), you have to parse the next word  and refer to it though, but let's gloss over that for now, and finally (&lt;strong&gt;triumph&lt;/strong&gt;) a noun ( it could also be a verb, but thanks to the grammar rule book we settled for a noun with meaning: ( victory,conquest), so in the end we have ( joining the meanings ):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A specific thing occurred of victory.&lt;/strong&gt; Close enough and I am glossing over a few other rules, but that's not the point, the other strategy is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lexical dictionary (or lexicon)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Where words or sounds are associated with specific meaning.

For example, development of human-like natural language processing (NLP) is necessary for intelligent agent to pass any verbal tests, or even non-verbal tests that requires processing of sentences of human language. Famous test that tests intelligence by asking questions in natural language and expects answers in the same form is Turing test. NLP still struggles with many (basic) human skills like listening, speaking, parsing and forming sentences. No one knows when we'll have system that can do these things as good as human. Since this system is crucial, but also far from human-like it's likely cause of delay in developing AI that passes intelligence test. Are these problems AI-hard? Do we need to develop strong AI to solve them?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can look at speech and listening as interfaces used for expressing and affecting inner processes of human brain.

This is akin to looking for a single shape that will fit all different shaped slots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, what is ignored is that animals are just as capable of emotions and emotional states as we are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When looking on Youtube for insects fighting each other, or competing or courting, it should be clear that simple creatures experience them too!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I challenge people about emotions, I suggest to them to go to Corinthians 13 - which describes the attributes of love. If you consider all those attributes, one should notice that an actual &quot;feeling&quot; is not required for fulfilling any of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the suggestion that a psychopath lacks emotions, and so he commits crimes or other pursuits outside of &quot;normal&quot; boundaries is far from true, especially when one considers the various records left to us from court cases and perhaps psychological evaluation - which show us that they do act out of &quot;strong&quot; emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be considered that a psychopath's behaviour is motivated out of negative emotions and emotional states with a distinct lack of or disregard of morality and a disregard of conscience.

Unless you're up for a real challenge this is probably what you should do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to build a single CNN that takes input of images as varying dimensions.  There are a number of ways you might try to do this, and I'm not aware of any published science analyzing these different choices.  The key is that the set of learned parameters needs to be shared between the different inputs sizes.  While convolutions can be applied at different images sizes, ultimately they always get converted to a single vector to make predictions with, and the size of that vector will depend on the geometries of the inputs, convolutions and pooling layers.  You'd probably want to dynamically change the pooling layers based on the input geometry and leave the convolutions the same, since the convolutional layers have parameters and pooling usually doesn't.  So on bigger images you pool more aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Practically you'd want to group together similarly (identically) sized images together into minibatches for efficient processing.

Take for example an artificial intelligence attempting to determine the meaning of a sarcastic sentence. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naturally spoken, the sentence &quot;That's just what I needed today!&quot; can be the expression of very different feelings. In one instance, a happy individual finding an item that had been lost for some time could be excited or cheered up from the event, and exclaim that this moment of triumph was exactly what their day needed to continue to be happy. On the other hand, a disgruntled office employee having a rough day could accidentally worsen his situation by spilling hot coffee on himself, and sarcastically exclaim that this further annoyance was exactly what he needed today. This sentence should in this situation be interpreted as the man expressing that spilling coffee on himself made his bad day worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is one small example explaining the reason linguistic analysis is difficult for artificial intelligence. When this example is spoken, small tonal fluctuations and indicators are extremely difficult for an AI with a microphone to detect accurately; and if the sentence was simply read, without context how &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; one example be discernible from the other?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rick Briggs suggests that Sanskrit, a form of communication sacred to Hinduism, is a naturally spoken language with mechanics and grammatical rules that would allow an artificial intelligence to more accurately interpret sentences during linguistic analysis.

Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning about knowledge, represented mainly as if–then rules rather than through conventional procedural code. The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s. Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the inference engine and the knowledge base. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CRUD webapps (websites that allows users to &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt; new entries in a database, &lt;strong&gt;Read&lt;/strong&gt; existing entries in a database, &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; entries within the database, and &lt;strong&gt;Delete&lt;/strong&gt; entries from a database) are very common on the Internet. It is a vast field, encompassing both small-scale blogs to large websites such as StackExchange. The biggest commonality with all these CRUD apps is that they have a knowledge base that users can easily add and edit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CRUD webapps, however, use the knowledge base in many, myriad and complex ways. As I am typing this question on StackOverflow, I see two lists of questions - &lt;strong&gt;Questions that may already have your answer&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Similar Questions&lt;/strong&gt;. These questions are obviously inspired by the content that I am typing in (title and question), and are pulling from previous questions that were posted on StackExchange. On the site itself, I can filter by questions based on tags, while finding new questions using StackExchange's own full-text search engine. StackExchange is a large company, but even small blogs also provide content recommendations, filtration, and full-text searching. You can imagine even more examples of hard-coded logic within a CRUD webapp that can be used to automate the extraction of valuable information from a knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we have a knowledge base that users can change, and we have an inference engine that is able to use the knowledge base to generate interesting results...is that enough to classify a system as being an &quot;expert system&quot;? Or is there a fundamental difference between the expert systems and the CRUD webapps?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This question could be very useful since if CRUD webapps are acting like &quot;expert systems&quot;, then studying the best practices within &quot;expert systems&quot; can help improve user experience.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastActivityDate="2016-12-11T05:51:09.103" Title="Are CRUD webapps today the modern version of the &quot;expert system&quot;?"

If an event arises that's unusual, the AI will have less relevant training on how to respond, so its reaction behavior &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; will be inferior to its routine &quot;standard operating procedure&quot;, for which is has been heavily trained.

Expressive modalities are how we recognize the operative context from the behaviors of other agents.  For an artificial agent, avoiding un-canniness would involve clustering the factors underlying the classification of discourse contexts, tagging them with corresponding factor models for manner in a way which closely aligned to the classifications which human agents make.  This involves developing an adequate latent representation for both spaces, which is likely to involve quite a lot of training data, or some clever transfer learning in conjunction with one-shot techniques (generally, taking samples as modes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the context becomes one of friendship, for example, the style factors of expression should extend to factors of trust, collaboration, disclosure, sympathy.  In order to implement these, layered abstractions in the representation of behaviors will need to be crafted, presumably by training.  In order to align these learned categories to human categories, which I suppose to be essential to emotional fluency, exploiting the structure of corpus semantics - including distributional characteristics of the linguistic labels and inferences - when estimating loss gradients seems a natural strategy, which exploits cultural learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These comments are necessarily speculative, as no such systems are current, to my knowledge.

It is artificial&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Synonyms: insincere, feigned, false.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is the idea that any &quot;intelligence&quot; created by humanity is not actually intelligent and, by definition, it is not possible. If you look at the structure of the human brain and compare it to anything humans have created thus far, &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the computers come close to the power of the brain. Sure they can hold data, or recognize images, but they cannot do everything the human brain can do as fast as the brain can do it with as little space as the brain occupies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically if a computer &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do that, how do we determine its intelligence? The word &lt;em&gt;artificial&lt;/em&gt; defines that the intelligence is not sincere or real. This means that even if humanity creates something that appears intelligent, it has simply become more complex. It is a better fake, but it is still fake. Any money not printed by the government is by definition counterfeit. Even if someone finds a way to make an exact duplicate, that doesn't mean that the money is legal tender.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;2. Misuse of power&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If an AI is given rights and chooses to &lt;em&gt;exercise&lt;/em&gt; those rights in a way that agrees with its creator's views, possibly through loyalty to its creator, or through hidden motives, then anyone with the capabilities to create such an AI would become extremely powerful by advancing their own beliefs through the creation of more AIs. This might also lead to the &lt;em&gt;ruthless parallelization&lt;/em&gt; that you mentioned, but with (even more) selfish goals in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this were not the case, and an AI could be created to be neutral with free will and &lt;strong&gt;uncontrollable by humans&lt;/strong&gt;, then perhaps an AI could be given rights. But I do not believe this would ever be the case. With great power comes great responsibility. Even with free will, a true AI would most likely end up serving humanity, because humans have control of the plugs and the electricity, the Internet, the software, and the hardware. The social implications of this for the AI are not promising. It's not even just the &lt;em&gt;ongoing&lt;/em&gt; control of these resources that is the issue. Whoever creates the software and hardware for the AI would have special knowledge. If fine adjustments were made, specific individuals would undoubtedly hold sole control of the AI, as adjustments could be made to the code in such a way that the AI behaves the same except under specific circumstances, and then when something goes wrong (assuming the AI has its own rights), then the AI would be blamed rather than the programmers who were responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;3. Anthropocentrism&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order for humanity to get away from anthropocentrism, we would have to become less selfish when it comes to &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt;, first. Until we can solve every existing social problem within humanity, there is no reason to believe that we could cease thinking of humanity as more important than created machines. After all, supposing there were an almighty God that created humanity, wouldn't the humans always be beneath God, never to be equals? We can't fully understand our own biology. If an AI were created, would it be able to understand its makings in the same way its creators would? Being the creator would give humanity a sense of megalomania. I do not think that we would relinquish our dominion over our own technological creations. That is as unlikely to happen as the wealthiest of humanity willingly giving the entirety of their money, power, and assets to the poorest of humanity. Greed prevents it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;4. Post-human fundamentalism&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humans worship technology with their attention, their time, and their culture. Some movies show technologically advanced robots suppressing mankind to the point of near-extinction. If this were the case and humanity were in danger of being surpassed by its technology, humanity would not stand idly and watch its extinction at the hands of its creation. Though people may believe superior technology could be created, in the event we reached such a point humanity would fight to prove the opposite, as our survival instincts would take over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;5. A balance?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I do not think the technology itself it actually possible, though people may be deceived into thinking such an accomplishment has been achieved. If the technology were completed, I still think that anthropocentrism will always lead, because if humanity is the creator, humanity will do its best to ensure it retains control of all technological resources, not simply due to fear of being made obsolete, but also because absolute power corrupts absolutely. Humanity does not have a good historical record when it comes to morality. There is always a poor class of people. If wealth were distributed equally, some people would become lazy. There is always injustice somewhere in the world, and until we can fix it (I think we cannot), then we will never be able to handle the creation of true AI.

IMHO, and there's lot of space for discussion, this has been driven mostly by two factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) including all the people fully in the society became an economical advantage, as it made them more productive participants in economy, allowing a more inclusive society to advance beyond societies neglecting large parts of their population in e.g. education and participation in skilled jobs;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) A more egalitarian society is not only more pleasant to live in but more secure, with less conflict and violence - again, giving an advantage to a more inclusive society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From this position, I'd argue that any realistic prediction about the future rights of intelligent AI (i.e., talking about what likely &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; happen instead of a theoretical discussion about what &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; happen) depends on how these two factors apply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we believe that the intelligent AI will be constructed so that (1) it's motivation doesn't really depend on it's rights, and it is fully committed to it's &quot;job&quot; anyway, and (2) &quot;full rights&quot; are orthogonal or even actively not desired by it's goal system, so the situation doesn't raise a risk of &quot;rebellion&quot; - then I'd expect that it would not be granted full rights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we believe that the intelligent AI will share human-like emotions (e.g. by being the result of &quot;mind uploading&quot; or full human brain simulation), then it's likely to eventually be granted full rights because of the same factors why we granted full rights to all the different disenfranchised groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1675" LastActivityDate="2016-12-19T02:50:26.533" CommentCount="1" />

Whether any of them bring us down a dark ally or directly toward the objective the question implied is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The array of common human desires are suggested by derivatives of Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  Self awareness is not among them.  From a cognitive science perspective, self awareness is not a desire but rather trait of consciousness.  The plausible explanations for its presence ranges between the extremes of a completely useless artifact of mental evolution to a deliberate infusion from some supreme entity, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other desires, traits, and capabilities listed in the question are easier to discuss in a way that is backed by existing cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and self-evident human experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regulating and prioritizing may an important element in intelligence beyond problem solving.  For instance, a sense of purpose is only a desire as one moves up the hierarchlistedny of needs.  People running from a Mammoth have no interest in purpose.  Regarding competent communication skills, what is and what is not sufficiently competent would require a definition, and not all humans may qualify all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sustainable ability to adapt is perhaps a super-set of intelligence in some ways, as in the case of the prioritization that exhibits the hierarchy of needs above and as in the case of DNA based adaptation.  In other cases adaptability may be a subset of intelligence, in the case of applying taught facts and logical deduction to select an optimal choice without the benefit of empirical observation or even trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The intelligent agent approach may produce something useful, but it is not likely the path that led to a human brain and may not produce anything like it.  We already understand what placing a number of such agents on a problem queue produces.  A time sharing computer is exactly of that architecture.  Parallel computing is not a significant deviation from that model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of the current extensions of automation architectures from Bell Labs, Harvard U, MIT, or other historical centers of electronic brain and robotic research and development have produced anything close to the varied integrated capabilities of a biologically healthy, socially aware, motivated human brain functioning as one of the controlling elements within a human body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do, however, have machines with human-like capabilities (simulations of task that were once manual), and such devices sometimes out-perform humans. But none of the existing automation is so integrated that they would blend in with humans.  Nonetheless, many already have careers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Single capability machines with job security:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Calculators&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Automated hoppers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Anti-aircraft weaponry&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mail sorting machines&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Speech recognizing devices&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Speech synthesis&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A general purpose computer, connected to a well designed, high end robot could do any combination of these and other things in a time shared way.  Several networked computers could provide parallel execution of these tasks and even make basic decisions on how to prioritize the various tasks within the computer network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the type of integration of sophisticated translation of arbitrary generalized goals to action leading to success and the imagination and prioritization of such sophisticated objectives is not yet available or at least deployed for general home, commercial, or industrial use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some available machines already accomplish well defined goals, but only within a very specific solution domain.  The interaction of various capabilities mentioned is still largely undiscovered at anything close to the level of detail necessary to produce synthetic capabilities of the same caliber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether it is possible to do so, Marvin Minsky voted yes, when he popularized his colleague's characterization of the human brain as a meat machine.

On top of this search algorithms are intuitive and non-mathematical, which makes the somewhat terrifying field of AI accessible. This might sound like hyperbole, but I guarantee that if your lecturer had opened with Manifold Learning Techniques half of your class would have bolted for the door by the time they mentioned 'eigenvalue of the covariance matrix'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now search algorithms aren't the only way to address these problems. I recommend every AI practitioner is familiar with the notion of Data Science and Machine Learning Algorithms. ML is often related to search algorithms but the techniques they use can vary heavily from iterative building of a classifier/regression (e.g. C4.5 builds a decision tree), meta-heuristics as you noted, and classifiers/regression that are statically generated from analysis of training data (e.g. Naive Bayesian is literally a classifier built on Bayesian analysis of the given data assuming that input fields are independent - this is the 'naivety' from which it gets its name). Often ML algorithms are developed in AI research groups and can sometimes be designed for specific problems instead of being general form algorithms. In contrast to the general field of AI, which is often centered on Intelligence problems and is therefore (in my view) vulnerable to too much blue sky thinking, ML is applied to all sorts of real life problems and is often very practical in its design and performance driven in its evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1467" LastActivityDate="2016-12-21T11:53:34.983" CommentCount="0" />

We all share a common biological background, our behavior, emotions and especially positive/negative feelings arise from the particular way how our brains are built. Man is by nature a social animal, and much of our behavior and feelings of empathy, compassion, fairness, greed, social status, etc are formed and expressed in society. Our minds are adjusted for this, as are the minds of other mammals. A human that forms an ethical system when joining a civil society does so in the basis of all this shared context, and within the limitations of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, all this is orthogonal to intelligence. All the variety of mankind encompasses a tiny island in the whole space of possible intelligences and their goals. Any system of ethics is feasible, a vast majority of them having no relationship whatsoever to what we could consider ethical. A human can be expected to join a society and learn ethics because our brain is hardwired to respond to social stimuli - an AI would learn ethics from a society only if its previous ethics already happen to value that highly, and that isn't likely to happen without careful design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a thought experiment that is commonly used as an example - the &quot;paperclip maximizer&quot;, an artificial agent with an ethical system that defines 'good' proportionally to the number of paperclips that exist in the universe and only that - and that is a &lt;em&gt;perfectly reasonable&lt;/em&gt; example, because a completely random ethical system is overwhelmingly likely to reduce to something stupid like that. The space of &quot;reasonable&quot; (to us) ethical systems is very tiny compared to all ethical systems possible, and expecting that a randomly selected ethical system will just happen to land there is like relying on winning a high-stakes lottery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;We want their ethics to contain certain things&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the main reason why we are studying AGI ethics is because we (or some of us) really, really, want the AGI ethical system to include certain things. For example, I'd like that ethical system to include my survival. I'd prefer that ethical system to be consistent with my happiness and wellbeing - and the very existence of a very powerful entity that simply happens to not care about me at all is not compatible with my survival and wellbeing, so I'd &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; prefer for it to care about me, or alternatively never become very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One could certainly argue that we have no right to constitute ethics, rules and morale for another society which could be much more intelligent and better than us. That another society might be &quot;better&quot; in some manner - but better &lt;em&gt;for whom&lt;/em&gt; ? If it's better for &quot;them&quot; but worse for me (and humanity), then I have strong motivation to simply &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; that right and try my hardest to ensure that this hypothetical future society includes me, my desires and my ethics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1675" LastActivityDate="2016-12-22T01:18:30.860" CommentCount="0" />

For fun, lets extend your problem to a much harder case, continuous variables, and see how we deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mood: range [-1, 1]   // 1 is Happy, 0 is Neutral, -1 is Sad&#xA;&#xA;Hunger: range [0, 1]  // 0 is Very Hungry, 1 is Full&#xA;&#xA;Food: range [0, 100] // amount of food, capping at 100 for numbers sake&#xA;&#xA;Time of day: [0, 23] // Hours, 9.5 would be 9:30 am&#xA;&#xA;Position x: range [-10, 10] // assuming the area the agent stays in is 10x10 km&#xA;&#xA;Position y: range [-10, 10]&#xA;&#xA;Money: range [0, 2000]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now its impossible to even count the number of states the agent could be in. An example of one state would be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mood, Hunger, Food, Time, PosX, PosY, Money&#xA;.5, .3, 67.4, 4.5, 0, 0, 5&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would mean that our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars. Which has happened to me once or twice before too so this is reasonable. &lt;strong&gt;If we we still wanted to generate a transition matrix and a reward matrix we would have to represent this state uniquely from other possibly similar states such as if the time was 5 pm with all other things equal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now how would we approach this?&#xA;First lets discretize or breakup each range into little chunks. Then we could have an array of 0s representing our chunks and assign a 1 to the index of the chunk we are in. Lets call this array our feature array. &#xA;If we did this for each dimension of our state information, we would end up with some state similar to what you originally proposed. I've chosen some arbitrary numbers to break up the state space and lets see what it does to the example state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we broke the Mood range up into 8 chunks of .25 we would have these ranges:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;m = Mood&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;-1.0 ≤ m &amp;lt; -.75&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;-.75 ≤ m &amp;lt; -.50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;-.50 ≤ m &amp;lt; -.25&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;-.25 ≤ m &amp;lt; 0.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;0.0 ≤ m &amp;lt; .25&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;.25 ≤ m &amp;lt; .50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;.50 ≤ m &amp;lt; .75&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;.75 ≤ m &amp;lt; 1.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we took the mood from the example state (.5), it would land in the 7th range, so then our feature vector for mood would look like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] &amp;lt;- represents a mood of .5&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lets do the same for hunger by splitting it into 8 chunks of .125:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] &amp;lt;- represents a hunger of .3&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We could then do something similar for each other state variable and break each state variable's range up into 8 chunks of equal sizes as well. Then after calculating their feature vectors, we would concatenate them all together and have a feature vector that is 56 elements long (7 state variables * 8 chunks each).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although this would give us 2^56 different combinations of feature vectors, it actually doesn't represent what we wanted to represent. We need features that activate (are 1) when events happen together. We need a feature that is 1 when we are hungry &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; when we have food. We could do this by doing a cross product of our 56 element feature vector with itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we have a 3136 element feature vector that has features like:&#xA;  1 if its 3pm and am happy&#xA;  1 if am full and out of food&#xA;  1 if at coordinate -3, 4 (Position x, Position y)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a step in the right direction but still isn't enough to represent or original example state. So lets keep going with the cross products!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we do 6 cross products we would have 30,840,979,456 features and only 1 of them would be on when our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point you are probably like &quot;Well.. thats a bit much&quot;, to which I would agree. This would be the curse of dimensionality, and is the reason transition tables stop being fun (if they ever were).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead lets take a different approach&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than trying to represent an individual state with an individual feature and saying whether that feature is good, lets go back to our nice 56 element feature vector. From here lets instead give a weight (w_i) to each of our 56 features. We have now entered the world of linear function approximation.

Therefore, the connected and non-connected figures would return the same result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I agree with the assertion that if there is a middle square which does not contain any of the k points, then we could not distinguish between the connected and non-connected figures, I don't understand how we get to that premise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question is: How can we say that there must be a middle square which does not contain any of the k points?

For instance, some reasonable definitions of intelligence might lead an unbiased judge to rate ants above humans.  Ants had been building in hexagons for millennia before humans blundered into the habit of building in rectangles.  Rectangles require over 70% more building material to build vertical structure per square foot of floor space than a packed hexagonal structure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Artificial Intelligence System Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Guessing that by, &quot;Basic AI,&quot; you mean some naive machine learning, there are a few basic components.  (The term Naive in this context means that the AI does not understand the domain or the meanings of symbols or signals it is processing in the way a human who had studied or worked within the field might understand them.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SENSING &amp;mdash; The machine (computer) must receive information, generally as a time series.  In human beings, these are the senses.  In a mail sorter, it may be a camera.  This is beyond just the concept of input in information technology.  It is more analogous to an input signal in a PID controller.  In an automated high speed trading machine, this would be the high speed version of a ticker tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTROL &amp;mdash; The machine must manipulate externals in a way that exploits the received information.  In a basketball player, this is the motor coordination, facial affect, verbal signals to teammates, and perhaps some verbal bait for opposing players.  In a mail sorter, this would be the motor control of mail direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEMORY &amp;mdash; The machine must have storage to audit input time series (perhaps from some transducer in the real world or some data store upon which some intelligent analysis or transformation must be done).  In more advanced systems, the machine may wish to analyze its own performance and make adjustments that converge on some optimal metric value (perhaps a historical maxima or minima) or some range of acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEEDBACK &amp;mdash; The machine must interpret some feedback signalling or use a predetermined scoring mechanism.  Learning cannot occur in an information vacuum, so some definition of better or worse must be established.  The feedback may be entangled within the SENSING channels or may arrive through a completely separate channel. In biological systems, these are often pre-wired as threat detection, pain, and pleasure.  The cerebral cortex uses concepts of goals and progress.  In some ways, child rearing and social strata exists to teach the boundaries of what constitutes an acceptable goal and acceptable methods for making progress toward it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MODELLING &amp;mdash; Whether implicitly or explicitly, some model must be developed and exploited.  Some would say that the existence of a model upon which the predictive capabilities of it can be applied to decision making to achieve some goal or weighted collection of goals is intelligence.  Others would say that the development of the model is intelligence and the use of it is merely control mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approaches to Simulating Human Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cognition is not the only form of model making, but the creation of cognitions and their application to decision making.  The concept of intelligence may have been furthered along a realistic path by Roger Schank, who proposed that the storage and indexing of stories was a primary characteristics of what humans recognize as intelligent conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Minsky and others took a direction that was more connected with logical inference work that began with logic formalization (originally George Boole) and Church's lambda calculus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Common Directions in Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The genetic algorithm influenced convergent technology and neuro-biology influenced neural net development.  Pattern matching is another limb off the larger set of technical approaches under the umbrella of classic Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are naive systems.  Like a neuron, the components have no idea of the meaning of what they are processing.  They are naive components.  An intelligent observer could not ascertain the real time meanings of signals and symbols between these naive components without extensive, perhaps life-long research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naive Bayesian methods are probabilistic in nature.  They exploit Bayes' Theorem, and have been found to produce excellent results in certain important domains.  Some studies have shown that naivety is actually a learning accelerant, which is interesting from an AI theory point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there is fuzzy (weighted) logic, which was an attempt to merge neural nets with production (rule based) systems.  Attempts to use this technology in transportation routing and scheduling has met much success.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are as many devices and architectures that attempt to effectively integrate or interconnect these various approaches as there are AI projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modelling Environment and Goal Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these systems, in some explicit or implicit way, model the external environment and the desired result of system behavior and attempt to converge (in real time) on that result.  Some sense-control functionality, which may change and adapt to the external environment is employed in the CONTROL component(s).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is just another way that the systems have an adaptive behavior.  Without necessarily knowing why, the system will manipulate what it can and continue to monitor the state of the environment to continually reach for the system's acceptance criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Basic AI system must to more than learn.  It must also judge its own functionality and therefore must have a layer of feedback and control that simulates the perception of optimality.  This higher level control must be integrated into the system at its inception for it to behave intelligently in the sense you probably mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Limitation and System Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more sophisticated and adaptive the modelling becomes, the more the cognitions, rules, stories, time series coefficients, weights, or whatever forms knowledge (not information) is stored, the more one can say that there is some form of understanding or comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One conjecture is that it is the recursion in layers of these capabilities that permits certain types of comprehension and awareness.  Other conjectures focus more on alertness and attention as keys to higher intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But these much more mature capabilities are beyond mere adaptation based on past knowledge or information and are therefore beyond what you probably meant by Basic AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4302" LastEditorUserId="4302" LastEditDate="2017-01-09T01:00:30.517" LastActivityDate="2017-01-09T01:00:30.517" CommentCount="0" />

Just, extract the data, randomly shuffle it and take first 80% of data to train and rest 20% of data to test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design a 2-2-2-1 neural network with bias units and some random initial weight values. This is because we will require minimum three lines to separate two classes, so 2 hidden layers (each consisting of 2 nodes and bias nodes) and 1 output layer (with bias node). The first layer is input layer with 2 nodes (no bias) as we have x-coordinate and y-coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Train your training data using this network using the Error Back Propagation algorithm i.e. update the weights between the layers and the bias weights too. Run the EBP algorithm for 100-2000 epochs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, use the test data to see, if you get the desired output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: I am NOT quite sure how to obtain the coordinates from the diagram. You can either manually note all points or research for some methods to get those points automatically from the image (some image processing algorithms).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1807" LastEditorUserId="1807" LastEditDate="2016-12-31T13:51:18.257" LastActivityDate="2016-12-31T13:51:18.257" CommentCount="2" />

While the problem is more natural, perhaps, for a Convolutional or Recurrent Neural Network, there's no problem to try and run this on a feed forward network. However, the way you give letters as input will be very confusing for a network and will make learning very hard. I'd recommend using one hot encoding or even a binary encoding for the letters.

Two systematic approaches are to start very simple and make the model more complicated, or start complicated and make your model simpler (or just normalize a lot). Look at the performance on the training set and on a separate validation set during training. If the model keeps on improving on the training data but starts to deteriorate on the validation data, you're probably over fitting. In this case you should either make the model simpler (fewer nodes, fewer layers) or regularize (start with l2 normalization on the weights). If the data doesn't perform well on the training data, you may wish to make the model more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you've tried the feedforward network, really do try CNN or RNNs for this task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4480" LastActivityDate="2017-01-02T13:31:52.200" CommentCount="1" />

I've seen several examples of papers where researchers use convnets to generate images, e.g. the adversarial system that generates pictures of birds and flowers, and a system that generates the next few frames of video when given a feed of a camera sweeping across the interior of a room, but all of those generated images seemed to be of the small square size I've been describing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I've seen lots of &quot;deep dream&quot; images over the past year or so that have been generated by convnets and are of a much larger size than ~220px by ~220px.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's my question: is it possible for me to build the system I describe, which takes a movie genre and outputs a movie poster of a size like e.g. 400px by 600px?

The research paper you're interested in is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irc.atr.jp/~drazen/pdf/HRI2015_Brscic.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Escaping from Children’s Abuse of Social Robots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that research paper, researchers were able to program the robots to follow a planning simulation to reduce the probability of abuse by children. If it detects children, the robot is programmed to retreat into a crowd of adults (who can then discipline the children if needed). This happened because the researchers saw that it was only children who were beating up the robots in the mall in question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They discuss trying out other options though:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In this work the robot’s strategy to prevent abuse was to “escape”, i.e. move to a location where it is less likely abuse will occur. One could ask why the robot cannot overcome the abuse. In our preliminary trials we have tried several approaches, but we found that it is very difficult for the robot to persuade children not to abuse it. For example, we changed the robot’s wordings in many ways, using strong words, emotional or polite expressions, but none of them were successful. One partially successful strategy was the robot ‘physically’ pushing children. When its way was blocked, it would just try to keep going and behave as if it will collide into children and force its way through (under careful monitoring from a human operator). We observed that children at first accepted the robot’s requests and obeyed them; but, very soon they learned that they are stronger than the robot so they can win if they push, and also that they can stop it by pushing the bumper switch (attached on the robot for safety). After realizing that, they just continued with the abusive behavior. Obviously having a stronger robot would present a problem for safety and social acceptance so dealing with such abusive situations remains difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But let's interrogate your question further:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If conscious AI is possible and is wide spread, wouldn't it be easy for someone who knows what they are doing to torture AI? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why would you consider such torture to be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;? After all, one could argue that the machine won't really 'experience' pain if you torture it...so it should be morally okay to torture the machine then. It may be respond as &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; it is in pain, but it's dubious whether the ability to simulate an emotional state such as &quot;being in pain&quot; is equivalent to actually &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; in that emotional state. See the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/34779/is-the-simulation-of-emotional-states-equivalent-to-actually-experiencing-emotio/35815&quot;&gt;Is the simulation of emotional states equivalent to actually experiencing emotion?&lt;/a&gt; for more discussion on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can make such an argument, but it won't really work on an emotional level because most humans would feel &lt;em&gt;empathy&lt;/em&gt; towards the machine. It may be hard to justify it logically (and it may be based on humans' tendencies to engage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;anthropomorphism&lt;/a&gt;), but we feel this empathy. It's this empathy that caused you to ask this question in the first place, caused researchers to figure out how to protect a robot from being beaten up, enabled police officers to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/09/07/national/crime-legal/drunken-kanagawa-man-60-arrested-after-kicking-softbank-robot-in-fit-of-rage/#.WHj4Rccc9Lp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;arrest a drunken Japanese man for beating up a SoftBank robot&lt;/a&gt;, and made many humans upset over the destruction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitchBOT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;hitchBOT&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; how AI abuse would be avoided - human empathy. If most humans care about the welfare of machines, they'll make it a priority to stop those few humans who are able and willing to abuse the machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The OP has edited his &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; to clarify that he is talking about &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt;, and not about robots. For robots, you can rely on anthropomorphism to produce some level of sympathy, but it's hard to sympathize with raw lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're not going to stop abuse of algorithms. Put it frankly, since the algorithms aren't like us, we aren't going to extend the same sort of empathy that we would to robots. Even chatbots are kinda iffy. If you could get people to sympathize with lines of code though (possibly by making a convincing simulation of emotion and sapience), then the above answer applies - humans anthropomorphize the machine and will come up with countermeasures. We aren't that level yet, so &quot;stopping AI abuse&quot; will be a low priority.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, some failsafes could be programmed in to limit the damage of abuse, as detailed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chatbots.org/ai_zone/viewthread/1488/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this thread on chatbot abuse&lt;/a&gt; - making the bot respond in a boring manner to make the abuser feel bored and move onto the next target, responding back to the abuser in a &quot;battle of wits&quot;, or even just blocking the abusers from using the service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These failsafes are cold comfort to those that want to &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; abuse, not respond to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also...an abuser can happily learn how to program an AI to then abuse to his/her heart's content. Nothing can be done to stop that, and any possible measures to stop said abuse (such as monitoring every human being to make sure they don't program an AI to abuse) will probably cause more damage than it'd solve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:42:22.960" LastActivityDate="2017-01-31T00:59:16.970" CommentCount="3" />

However, the only way to surmount this is to expose a prototype A.I. to the main problems; help it to solve them, and then to take its memory and use it as a template for other A.I's.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technically, AI's which have learned to solve prior problems could make their memories available to others on demand, so that an inexperienced AI could solve an issue without having achieved the skills needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I would like to add that mimicking intelligence is not in itself &quot;intelligence&quot;. Many programmers fall into the trap of believing that to emulate something is qualitatively the same expression as the genuine article. This is a fallacy which infers that we only have to simulate intelligence without understanding the real mechanisms which create it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &quot;copying&quot; of sentience is done all the time and despite how good we have become in copying over the last few years, each new algorithm is just that:  a simulation without genuine sentience or intelligence!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4828" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:53:10.013" LastActivityDate="2017-01-20T12:21:59.857" CommentCount="0" />

I am wondering if there is some way of &quot;correcting&quot; the model when it makes mistakes while not compromising the desirable behavior on translations where it previously performed well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an experiment, I took a model that I had previously trained and gathered several examples of translations where it performed poorly. I then took those examples and put them into their own small training set where I provided more desirable translations than what the model was outputting. I then trained the old model on this new small training set very briefly (3-6 training steps was all it took to &quot;learn&quot; the new material). When I tested the new model it translated those several examples in the exact way I had specified. But as I should have anticipated the model overcompensated to &quot;memorize&quot; those handful of new examples  and thus I noticed it started to perform poorly on translations that it had previously been excellent. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there some way to avoid this behavior short of simply retraining the model from scratch on an updated data set?

It is extremely easy to see that this is wrong, because A* is a search algorithm that guarantees to find an optimal solution given that only admissible heuristics are used. (A heuristic is being admissible if it never over-estimates the optimal goal distance. This is the case in your example.) Since the true cost for reaching G1 is 11 and the true cost for reaching G2 is 13, clearly G1 must be found first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, your expansion order is wrong as well. Let us first give the f-values for all nodes:&#xA;&lt;code&gt;f(A)=11, f(B)=10, f(C)=11, f(D)=13&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that h(G1)=h(G2)=0 (i.e, the heuristic is &quot;goal-aware&quot;), we get &lt;code&gt;f(G1)=11&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;f(G2)=13&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because A* expands search nodes by lowest f-values of the search nodes in the open list (the search nodes not yet expanded), we get the following expansion order:&#xA;&lt;code&gt;R, B, A, C, G1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You very-likely did a mistake that is done extremely often: after heaving expanded D, you add G2 to the open list. Because G1 is a goal node and you are already &quot;seeing&quot; it, you return it as a solution. But this is wrong! Goal nodes are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; returned when being created, but when being selected for expansion! So, although the expansion of D generates G2, you are not allowed to return G2 as solution, because it has not been selected for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Can G2 be found as well?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;NietzscheanAI&lt;/em&gt; pointed out, you can simple continue search.

It cannot be brute-forced no matter how fast processors get.  Go is so complex humans had failed to produce AI that could win against a skilled human player.  The fact that a computer could teach itself to do something humans couldn't teach it, and something with a complexity analogous to nature to boot, is pretty extraordinary.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial games in particular are useful because, unlike nature where it may be impossible to track or even be aware of every variable, intractability can be generated out of a simple set of elements and rules, and outcomes can be definitively evaluated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As proof-of-concepts for methods go, AlphaGo seems like a pretty strong one.  It allows us to definitively say &quot;Machine Learning works&quot;, puts a lot of emphasis on the field, and raises confidence on extending the method to real world problems.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, it suggests a feedback loop in which programs can improve at at improving, unrestricted by human limitations.

Also, in your environment you should promote the spreading of organisms which responses are euristically better i.e. cells that don't get caught by predators or don't die by starvation. How?

All these definitions are part of one (or more) of the areas. There are four main domains, and the picture below will shed some light over this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/m7ZlO.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/m7ZlO.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turing Test revolves around the left side of the cardinality, which is mostly concerned with how humans think or act. But, we know that this is just not all. Turing Test has not much to offer when it comes to what AI is in a general sense.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Turing Test, as the Wikipedia states, was created to test machines exhibiting behaviour equivalent or indistinguishable from that of a human. Artificial Intelligence is much more than what humans can do or how they act. There are many human acts that are considered unintelligent and sometimes inhuman too.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Chinese Room Argument&lt;/a&gt; focuses on something every important when it comes to &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Consciousness v/s Simulation of Consciousness&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. John Searle argued there that it is possible for a machine (or human) to follow a huge number of predefined rules (algorithm), in order to complete the task, without thinking or possessing the mind. Weak AIs are good at simulating the ability to understand but, don't really understand what they are doing. They don't exhibit &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Self-Awareness&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; and don't form representation about themselves. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;I want that v/s I know I want that&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; are two different things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As Theory of Mind states that a good AI should not just form representation about the world it is working on, but also about other agents and entities in the world. This two concepts of &lt;em&gt;self-awareness and theory of mind&lt;/em&gt; draw a thin line between weak and strong AI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;When it comes to the Turing Test, it fails on many grounds and so does the Total Turing Test, which adds another layer to the test. Most of the researchers believe that Turing Test is just a distraction from the main goal, something that hinders them from fruitful work. Consider this, suppose you ask a difficult arithmetic problem in order to distinguish between human and machine. If the machine wants to pretend it is human then it will lie. This is not what we want. Going for the Turing Test sets the upper bound to the AI that can be created. Also making AI act and behave like humans is not a very good idea. Humans are not very good at making right decisions all the time. This is the reasons why we read about wars in our history books. Decisions which we make are often biased, have selfish origins, etc. We don't want an AI to come with all those things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I don't think there is one test to test an AI. This is because AI has many definitions, many types. Whether an AI is weak or strong can be tagged while looking for answers to questions like, &quot;I want that v/s I know I want that&quot;, &quot;Who am I and what exactly I am doing (from machine's perspective)&quot;, plus some other questions I mentioned above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3005" LastActivityDate="2017-01-23T14:21:49.407" CommentCount="0" />

What are the advantages/disadvantages?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answer to this question is that there are lots of problems where the solution can be found using searching. Take an example of Tic Tac Toe. If you are designing an intelligent computer player for this, then what you will do is that you will form a search space and then you will search for most optimal move which can be made to conclude the game. In these, scenarios you must be aware of optimal search strategies. Let's take another example, suppose if you are driving and want to got to an unknown person's house. It's far from your place and you decide to use GPS. Your GPS will use search algorithms to find the most optimal route that you can take to reach to the destination (of course there will be lots of factors to consider like traffic, etc. but this is the basic idea).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages are only in terms of processing and storage. For slow algorithms you will be wasting lots of CPU time and storage as well but for good and efficient algorithms, you can preserve lots of space and also execute your task very fast. Of course, just learning about searching isn't AI. There's lot more to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's more than &quot;searching&quot; in AI that could be taught in an introductory course?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is lots of things in AI other than searching. For example, learning techniques (supervised, unsupervised, reinforced), planning when one wants to design a system that will do certain actions independently and intelligently, representation of knowledge (known and unknown) and inference in agents which includes propositional logic and first-order logic, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there theories behind AI that could be taught in this kind of course?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some topics could be taught like about different types of agents (simple reflex, model based, goal based, utility based and learning agent), different types of environments in which agents work, evaluation of agents.

Legal liability and consumer safety are the same issue when looked at from the perspective of &quot;cost to consumer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And here are few dilemmas:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Does the algorithm recognize the difference between a human being and&#xA;  an animal?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If an animal/human cannot be legally avoided (and car is in legal right - if its not then something else is wrong with the AI's decision making), it likely won't. If the car can safely avoid the obstacle, the AI could reasonably be seen to make this decision, ie. swerve to another lane on an open highway. Notice there is an emphasis on liability and driver safety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Does the size of the human being or animal matter?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only the risk factor from hitting the obstacle. Hitting a hippo might be less desirable than hitting the ditch. Hitting a dog is likely more desirable than wrecking the customer's automobile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Does it count how many passengers it has vs. people in the front?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It counts the people as passengers to see if the car-pooling lane can be taken. It counts the people in front as a risk factor in case of collision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Does it &quot;know&quot; when babies/children are on board?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Does it take into the account the age (e.g. killing the older first)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No. This is simply the wrong abstraction to make a decision, how could this be weighted into choosing the right course of action to reduce risk factor? If Option 1 is hit young guy with 20% chance of significant occupant damage and no legal liability and Option 2 is hit old guy with 21% chance of significant occupant damage and no legal liability, then what philosopher can convince even just 1 person of the just and equitable weights to make a decision?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the best decision a lot of the time is to hit the breaks to reduce speed (especially when you consider that it is often valuable to act predictably so that pedestrians and motorists can react accordingly). In the meantime, better value improvements can be made in terms of predicting when drivers will make bad decisions and when other actions (such as hitting the reverse) are more beneficial than hitting the breaks. At this point, it is not worth it to even begin collecting the information to make the ethical decisions proposed by philosophers. Thus, this issue is over-hyped by sensational journalists and philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5157" LastEditorUserId="5157" LastEditDate="2017-02-01T22:47:41.597" LastActivityDate="2017-02-01T22:47:41.597" CommentCount="0" />

I've read as much as I can on the subject (that I can grasp) and believe I understand all the broad concepts and some of the workings (despite being very weak in maths), neurons, synapses, weights, cost functions, backpropagation etc. However, I've not been able to figure out how to translate real world problems into a neural network solution. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Case in point, Adam Geitgey gives as an example usage, a house price prediction system where given a data set containing &lt;strong&gt;No. of bedrooms&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sq. feet&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Neighborhood&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sale price&lt;/strong&gt; you can train a neural network to be able to predict the price of a house. However he stops short of actually implementing a possible solution in code. The closest he gets, by way of an example, is basic a function demonstrating how you'd implement weights:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def estimate_house_sales_price(num_of_bedrooms, sqft, neighborhood):&#xA;  price = 0&#xA;&#xA;  # a little pinch of this&#xA;  price += num_of_bedrooms * 1.0&#xA;&#xA;  # and a big pinch of that&#xA;  price += sqft * 1.0&#xA;&#xA;  # maybe a handful of this&#xA;  price += neighborhood * 1.0&#xA;&#xA;  # and finally, just a little extra salt for good measure&#xA;  price += 1.0&#xA;&#xA;  return price &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other resources seem to focus more heavily on the maths and the only basic code example I could find that I understand (i.e. that isn't some all singing, all dancing image classification codebase) is an implementation that trains a neural network to be an XOR gate that deals only in 1's and 0's.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there's a gap in my knowledge that I just can't seem to bridge. If we return to the &lt;strong&gt;house price prediction&lt;/strong&gt; problem, hows does one make the data suitable for feeding into a neural network?

Or do you need to transform them into something else? Similarly what about the &lt;strong&gt;Normaltown&lt;/strong&gt; value, that's a string, how do you go about translating it into a value a neural network can understand?

If your data is not well-behaved (i.e. fraught with outliers) then you may need to do more work normalizing the inputs and outputs. Some of the more advanced methods are described &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.ccu.edu.tw/~wylin/BA/Fusion_of_Biometrics_II.ppt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I will assume that you are using f(x) = tanh(x) as your activation function. If you aren't, you should still be able to reason through how to normalize your data after reading this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prepare the input data:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that you want a significant variation in each input parameter to be reflected by a significant variation in the activation of the neuron those inputs are being fed into. By looking at a plot of the derivative of the tanh(x) actiavtion function, you'll see that the region of significant slope is within a distance of one or two from the origin. This means that whether the input to the activation function is 2000 or 3000 (values of x for which the derivative is negligibly small), the output of the activation will be almost identical...so your neuron's state will be independent of the difference between 2000 and 3000, and your network will never produce any predictive power from values in that range. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to input the square footage of the house into a neuron, you need to &lt;em&gt;normalize&lt;/em&gt; the square footage so that the network can tell the difference between 2000 and 3000. One way to do this so that all of the significant variations in your data are 'noticed' by the neuron is to &lt;strong&gt;z-score-normalize the inputs&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gather all of your square footage values (from your training set) and calculate the mean and standard deviation. &lt;em&gt;Store the mean and standard deviation&lt;/em&gt;---you'll need this information to normalize new square footage values when testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normalize the vector of square footage values by subtracting the mean and then dividing the result by the standard deviation&lt;/strong&gt; (all operations element-wise of course). Subtracting the mean centers your data at the origin, and dividing by the standard deviation makes sure most of it is between -1 and 1, where the neuron's output is most sensitive to its input. This is called z-score normalization because each input value is replaced by its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;z-score&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do the above for each input variable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, when you put each input value through a neuron, the output of the neuron is an activation between -1 and 1 (look at the image of tanh(x)). Since this is already in the 'sensitive' range of the activation function, you don't need to worry about altering the output of the input-layer neurons before sending them to the first hidden layer. Just &lt;strong&gt;give any hidden layer neurons the outputs of the previous layer directly&lt;/strong&gt;---they will be able to handle them just fine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you reach the last layer (the output neuron(s)), what you get is again another activation between -1 and 1. You have to convert this back into a value for the house in question&lt;/strong&gt;, whether that value will be used as a prediction in a test set or to calculate error during training. However you do this, you just have to be consistent and use the same de-normalization procedure in training and testing. One way to think about it is: when the output neuron(s) returns 1, that means the network is returning the &lt;em&gt;maximum possible house value&lt;/em&gt; as its prediction. &lt;em&gt;What should the highest value the network can estimate be?&lt;/em&gt; The right approach here simply depends on your application. This is what I did:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Calculate the mean of [the/each] output variable and store it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Calculate the maximum deviation of the output variable from the mean. &#xA;Python: &lt;code&gt;MaxDev = max([abs(DataPoint-numpy.mean(TrainingData)) for DataPoint in TrainingData])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When the network returns output(s) between -1 and 1, multiply the output by &lt;code&gt;MaxDev&lt;/code&gt; and add it to the mean.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two basic quick checks you can do to see if your normalization-renormalization scheme is suitable (these are necessary, but perhaps not sufficient conditions):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If all the input values are average (e.g. average no. of bedrooms, average sq.feet, etc), is the network's output equal to the average of the output variable (e.g. house value) as well? (It should be.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If all the input values are unusually high/low, is the network's output unusually high/low as well? (This only works if all the inputs are positively related to the output...if some of them are inversely related related, you will have to think a bit more).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Observe that the scheme presented here satisfies these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notice that this scheme would allow your network to only predict house values &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the range of house values in your training data set. Depending on the application, this behavior can be desirable or undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example: you may want to make it impossible for your network to predict negative house values. Think about how you would do this. De-normalize the output so that -1 is mapped to 0.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to set no limit on the values your network can predict, then you can run the network's output through a function that maps the [-1,1] range to all real numbers...like arctanh(x)! As long as you do this during training your network will adjust its weights to accommodate this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this was helpful. Let me know if you have further questions. My ANN module is in Python, by the way, so I might have language-specific advice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5037" LastActivityDate="2017-02-08T08:45:44.100" CommentCount="5" />

Logic programming refers to languages like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Prolog&lt;/a&gt; where you have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;declarative&lt;/a&gt; style of programming compared to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;imperative&lt;/a&gt; style like you have in Pascal.

For instance, a model represents a certain part of the reality. Imagine a cup on a table. If the agent has a representation of this situation, it has a symbol &lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt; and a symbol &lt;code&gt;cup&lt;/code&gt; which represents the things in the real world. Now it can have a relation &lt;code&gt;on(cup, table)&lt;/code&gt; which represents the situation that the cup is on the table. This type of abstraction can be easily represented in a logic language like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)#If.E2.80.93then.28.E2.80.93else.29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;first order logic&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, one uses logic programming languages like Prolog or other types of languages like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;OWL&lt;/a&gt; to represent knowledge and perform reasoning.

That is not meant with representation. Brooks' Creatures have only this information and calculate with this data directly to perform an action without reasoning. In that sense also artificial neural networks have no representation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, for an open source project to understand representation I would recommend the above mentioned OWL.

Computer vision is the science that aims to give a similar, if not better, capability to a machine or computer/software program[intelligent Agent].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robot Vision &amp;amp; Machine Vision(intelligent vision)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Robot Vision involves using a combination of camera hardware and computer algorithms to allow robots to process visual data from the world. For example, your system could have a 2D camera which detects an object for the robot to pick up. A more complex example might be to use a 3D stereo camera to guide a robot to mount wheels onto a moving vehicle.Just like Google's self driving Car. And remember robot vision is closely related to Machine Vision(though Machine Vision refers to the industrial use of vision for automatic inspection, process control).&#xA;Without Robot Vision, your robot is essentially blind. This is not a problem for many robotic tasks, but for some applications Robot Vision is useful or even essential.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where it starts to get a little more complex is when we include Pattern Recognition into the family tree, or more broadly Machine Learning. This branch of the family is focused on recognising patterns in data, which is quite important for many of the more advanced functions required of Robot Vision. For example, to be able to recognise an object from its image, the software must be able to detect if the object it sees is similar to previous objects. Machine Learning, therefore, is another parent of Computer Vision alongside Signal Processing/image processing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, not all Computer Vision techniques require Machine Learning. You can also use Machine Learning on signals which are not images. In practice, the two domains are often combined like this: Computer Vision technique can detect features and information from an image, which are then used as an input to the Machine Learning algorithms. For example, Computer Vision technique detects the size and color of parts on a conveyor belt, then Machine Learning decides if those parts are faulty based on its learned knowledge about what a good part should look like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are such methods/techniques being used or worked on today?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Dean, Google Senior Fellow and head of Brain team that just put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt; machine learning library into open source, gave the opening day keynote on deep learning, a powerful class of machine learning that allows machines to understand what they are seeing. These algorithms are trained by exposing them to huge amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example. 1000’s of tagged pictures of a car or people or animals, so they learn to recognize an unknown similar image very accurately, even if the object is somewhat obscured. They are now even able to interpret context. It’s not just a picture of a “baby”, but the algorithm comes back with “A baby is asleep next to a teddy bear”. it's therefore,quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So,according to such scenario;you can analyse critically and guess what technique is applied! and real progress is made on this;don't forget that these are millions invested in these projects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gestalt Processing,inline with it's application(research with progress)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Advertisers are using the basic gestalt process in the television medium focus on how the viewer responds to the entire message for instance the sounds, colors and distinct images seen in the commercial. The response varies from viewer to viewer, depending on age, emotional background, physical condition, level of education and social class. How the individual responds is his gestalt. Depending on the product or service, advertisers target the message to specific viewer demographics, who share common gestalt responses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Similarity Principle&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When conducting an ad campaign, marketers use the gestalt processing when reducing the product to a basic design theme, logo or slogan. Think of famous ad lines or instantly-recognizable symbols, such as McDonald's golden arches. That symbol evokes hamburgers and french fries to anyone remotely familiar with advertising, although the logo itself does not display food. Advertisers strive for individuality when marketing products, so the viewer or customer doesn't confuse their product with a competitor's item. However, under gestalt principles, customers won't confuse completely different products, such as cars and food, or clothes and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Perception&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In advertising, perception is reality. Advertisers using gestalt principles must consider how the message they use is perceived by potential customers and how this message prompts action -- buying the product or service. Media and advertising professionals use gestalt theory to create effective ways to sell products whether using images or conceiving of the most beneficial forms of distribution. Figuring the overall success rate of using gestalt principles is also based in simplicity -- sales results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore;according to such scenario,companies like Amazoon,IBM,Google to mention but a few a have applied all the above methods or techniques and are still booming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1581" LastActivityDate="2017-02-09T14:31:44.300" CommentCount="0" />

Following each projectile the agent analysed the movement made by the participant to determine paths of future projectiles in order to increase the chance of driving participants to the goal position and make them stay there as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Update 1: &lt;a href=&quot;http://rexa.gordarg.com/Documents/Download/5becaa12-ce68-47a9-8cb6-f8ccc3d14059&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Download: Reinforcement Learning as a tool to make people move to a speciﬁc location in Immersive Virtual Reality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5398" LastEditorUserId="5398" LastEditDate="2017-02-11T11:29:51.367" LastActivityDate="2017-02-11T11:29:51.367" Title="A solution for a famous problem in RL" Tags="&lt;reinforcement-learning&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="0" />

This is obviously a very difficult task, but the number of syllables and stresses is fundamental numerical data of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to validate to human tastes, you'd then have to use a captcha crowdsourcing method, for both the rhythmic stresses as input, and getting human reactions to different line-break configurations.  You would then reinforce the positive reactions, and the AI would tailor the line-break process to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, instead of utilizing human tastes and aesthetic sensibilities, you could instead let the AI decide what is preferred, which would probably be comprised of some sort of symmetry considered optimal to an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following this logic, you wouldn't even need to have the AI learn the stresses, instead just focusing on raw syllables, or, numeric representation based on any factor. (With this method, the object is not to reformat poetry for humans, but for machines :)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is more about the aesthetics, but Cameron Browne's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cameronius.com/games/shibumi/browne-elegance-5.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Elegance in Game Design&lt;/a&gt; would seem to suggest there are engineering solutions to the type of aesthetic issues at the root of your problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might start by teaching it to count the syllables of the poem, then having it look at the divisors. If it's roughly 10, it might be iambic pentameter. The AI doesn't care about the label, but it likes 10.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;20 syllables might represent a couplet in that meter:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The time is out of joint, oh cursed spite&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;that ever I was born to set it right&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd definitely start by feeding it older poetry, particularly poets that keep to strict meter. It's been a while since I've read Spencer and so forth, but I'd think poets of his time would be useful.  Dr. Seuss, perhaps the greatest wielder of the rhyming couplet, would surely be extraordinarily useful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The evaluation method would have to be fuzzy, because there would be increasing degrees of variance the more modern the poetry, ultimately resulting in free structures, except in the case of forms such as rap, which strongly utilize regularized rhythm. Machine learning is all about estimation and reinforcement, and is proving to be extremely useful dealing with fuzziness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;is a great example of modern line of poetry: the floor of 13 syllables / 2 makes a 6 beat line.  Understanding that in context with the surrounding verse is much more difficult and illustrates the nature of the problem. Even scanning the poem correctly to that point to determine would be extremely difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, a different poem by the same author is extremely useful:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the late November doing / With the disturbance of the spring / And creatures of the summer heat, / And snowdrops writhing under feet / And hollyhocks that aim too high / Red into grey and tumble down / Late roses filled with early snow? / Thunder rolled by the rolling stars / Simulates triumphal cars / Deployed in constellated wars / Scorpion fights against the sun / Until the Sun and Moon go down / Comets weep and Leonids fly / Hunt the heavens and the plains / Whirled in a vortex that shall bring / The world to that destructive fire / Which burns before the ice-cap reigns&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All lines of roughly 8 syllables, easy to pick out because of capitalization.  But the real question is: ~136 13 lines of roughly 10 syllables, or 17 lines of roughly 8?  It would want to calculate based on word blocks (words that cross syllabic thresholds and at least tell you where the break &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be, and it should be possible to statistically divine the pattern, at least for regularized verse.)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The wounded surgeon plies the steel / That questions the distempered part; /&#xA;  Beneath the bleeding hands we feel / The sharp compassion of the healer's art &#xA;  / Resolving the enigma of the fever chart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This verse highlight the problem.  5 lines of 4 beats, but syllabically: 8, 8, 8, 10, 12.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most likely: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/5 = 9.2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/4 = 11.5&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/6 = 7.66&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Less likely:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/3 = 15.3&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/2 = 23  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/7 = 6.57&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2 lines has less perfect symmetry, but 5 lines is more likely, based on the overall number of syllables, and of the likely choices, has the least variance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately it would be looking for the underlying structure, or lack of structure, and try to reorganize the unbroken text into something &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to the original structure.  While exactness is not always required because the process is ultimately subjective, and currently intractable, certain wrong choices would yield disastrous results. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the prior example it may be able to discern the likelihood of a 5 line pattern, but it would have to figure out on which lines to place the extra syllables.  Differentiating between particles and other parts of speech provides a clue, because the poet's language is very compact: there are 19 nouns, verbs, or prepositions.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More likely:&#xA; - 19/5 = 3.8&#xA; - 19/4 = 4.75&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Less likely:&#xA; - 19/3 = 6.33&#xA; - 19/6 = 3.16&#xA; - 19/7 = 2.71&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis might narrow it down.  But extremely regularized verse remains the best place to start.  7 lines of roughly 10 syllables is &quot;poetic&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;‘The aged man that coffers-up his gold&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Is plagu’d with cramps and gouts and painful fits;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  But like still-pining Tantalus he sits,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  And useless barns the harvest of his wits;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Having no other pleasure of his gain&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  But torment that it cannot cure his pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It cares about both X and Y values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initially you want to keep it to a single language, because syllables may be treated differently.  That said, having the AI look for something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylic_hexameter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dactylic hexameter&lt;/a&gt; would be extremely useful, because you could feed it Homer. You could also feed it Homer in English in many different forms of English meter, and in almost every other living language. By definition, the AI would value works such as these, because max number_of_translations provides the most robust data set. When it starts to value meaning, this will be especially important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding different ways of treating syllables(long/short vs. stressed/unstressed) will also be essential as it transitions into more modern poetry.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/meter.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here is a good link for basic English meter.&lt;/a&gt;  Iambic and Trochaic meters will be easy, while meters that employ Anapests, Dactyls and Spondees will be more challenging. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, however, these will be mathematically interchangeable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I went to the Garden of Love, / And saw what I never had seen: / A Chapel was built in the midst, / Where I used to play on the green. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter if the lines above are iambic/trochaic or dactylic/anapestic, it's still 4 lines of roughly 8 syllables.  Thus &quot;I went to the Garden of Love&quot; is the same as &quot;The wounded surgeon plies the steel&quot;, even though the beats for the lines are 3 and 4, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should also have a stanza marker, (possibly 00?). Because it looks for patterns within patterns, stanzas are valued.  Not all poetry has a stanza structure, but it arguably could. Deciding if stanzas are appropriate is partly a function of taking a syllabic divisor, breaking the poem down into number_of_lines, and looking at the divisors of that number. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would need an added function to be able to recognize meaning patterns.  For instance, repetition of proper nouns is the marker of plays. (From a meaning perspective, imo, plays is the ideal place to start because the marker is so easy to learn, and names all belong to a single set, and imply communication. It's no different functionally than any other identifier, and a concept all computers &quot;understand&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually it would want to look for phonetic patterns, rhymes and near rhymes, which would also be indicators of potential good places for line breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a very big data set that it can look at, and who knows what it might discern?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1671" LastEditorUserId="1671" LastEditDate="2017-02-19T21:55:04.943" LastActivityDate="2017-02-19T21:55:04.943" CommentCount="0" />

The idea was to get away from the 1980's popular approach of a single global representation of all the components of the problem space that had required the task of robot task planning to juggle every  constraint in the world into one giant disordered mess of states and state transitions.  Rather than represent every element in the world in a single model (The Representation), Brooks suggested it was preferable to build a hierarchy of submodels of the world (subsets of states and transitions) in which smaller tasks could be more readily planned.  Then as these rudimentary skills were mastered, they could be combined to address a hierarchy of bigger and more complex tasks (bigger tasks subsume smaller tasks and benefit from their already having been solved).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, representation did not fully go away, but it was redistributed hierarchically so that much of the state could be abstracted away from the higher level of the bigger problem that you need to solve.  Planning became like coordinating a hierarchical army of skills, where the general doesn't need to plan every movement of the private in order to manage a battle.  Instead, that general need only tell the colonels what to do, and the colonels tell the majors, and so on down to the privates.  Now the general solves problems by coodinating multiple sub-hierarchies available to him/her by delegating authority to coordinate behavior at the appropriate level of abstraction: like division, brigade, battalion, company, and squad.  That's Brooks' Subsumption Architecure: the general needs to represent a battle plan only as &quot;the world according to colonels&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1657" LastActivityDate="2017-02-16T04:58:06.970" CommentCount="0" />

These types of machines can be just as transformative - ultrafast machines may solve problems quickly due to &quot;brute force&quot;, and ultrastrong machines can use its raw power for a variety of physical tasks. Perhaps a ultra-X machine can't build another ultra-X machine (as I.J.

That's pretty obvious because neurons die all the time, but we don't wake up and have forgotten how to recognise the letter 'A'. In fact we have to take out rather big chunks of the neocortex until functionality degrades, which is why Alzheimer's patients show symptoms only when the brain is already visibly messed up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Translational invariance within a level of the hierarchy has to be learned. Basically you need filters for the same edge all over your V1. An object moving across your field of vision only becomes invariant in it's representation on a higher level. Unfortunately we don't magically learn a representation that we can easily turn and twist, our ability to recognise objects from an unusual angle degrades with how uncommon the angle is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A nice thought experiment to illustrate the point: Imagine a cube sitting in front of you. Now pull one of the corners of the cube upwards until the cube is dangling in front of you, one corner pointing straight to the ceiling, the opposite corner pointing to the ground. Now indicate with your finger where the rest of the corner are. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are anything like me, this is really difficult. I think the first time I did't even realise I had to point out six corners! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course this is 3D and we might still have inbuilt 2D invariance, but it also turns out that faces that are turned upside down have to be processed much higher into the cortex to be recognised as faces and so on ... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concerning the learning of a lot of different feature vectors across the field of vision: This might be prevented by the fact that the neocortex learns sequences of input by predicting (via depolarisation) the next pattern. So you might have the situation that a higher level tells the lower level that there is an object moving from left to right and the lower level will predict that the edge it is detecting at point y will reoccur at point y+x.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This setup differs from the training of NNs in two ways: The data is already translational and the translation is predicted, which facilitates learning the same features. Basically two pattern recogniser close to each other get pretty much the same pattern one after the other whenever something moves in a certain direction and the second occurrence is predicted, which means it will be more likely detected, which means it will be learned. (I don't want to dole out a lecture about the cortex, but the prediction is a big deal because it allows neurons to fire quicker which means they beat other neurons before they are laterally inhibited and only if they actually fire will they learn.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a disclaimer I want to add that this is just my current understanding of the issue and I'm pretty sure the actual explanation is more complicated. For example I've read that one of the layers of the cortex is important for translational invariance and this layer only exists in the levels close to the sensory input. It is conjectured that this layer (L4) doesn't do the sequence prediction stuff, so maybe having the same kind of input is enough or learning different feature vectors is not actually a problem. There is also the complicating issue that there is poorly understood interplay between the different layers and different levels of the cortex. I would recommend to ask a neuroscientist, except I don't think they figured this out yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2227" LastActivityDate="2017-02-22T10:11:26.350" CommentCount="2" />

But one way or another, it has to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Non-intelligent species will simply starve and die quietly when there’s insufficient food. &#xA;But intelligent species will form identity groups and hold riots and protests, and eventually go to war. &#xA;These will be the cyclic crisis wars of extermination specified by Generational Dynamics and every intelligent species in the universe will have them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this can give you a glimpse,then just know Artificial Intelligence ain't no joke.....Lets study it hard...so that we see such a future.&#xA;Special Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;StackExchange&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1581" LastActivityDate="2017-02-27T11:04:32.917" CommentCount="0" />

How can one approach it? With formal logic steps one can trace a formal decision process, but with NN there may be no formal logic, especially if it gets complex enough (in a couple of decades say), there are just 20 billion neural processors and their I/O weightings and connections, it may not be possible to determine what caused some incident even if lives were lost. It also may not be possible to say more than the systems continually learn and such incidents are rare. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also haven't heard of any meaningful way to do a &quot;black box&quot; or flight recorder equivalent for NNs, (even if not used i  a life critical case), that would allow us to understand and avoid a bad decision. Unlike other responses to product defects, if a NN could be trained after the event to fix one such case, it doesn't clearly provide the certainty we would want, that the new NN setup has fixed the problem, or hasn't reduced the risk and balance of other problems in so doing.

However, training and inference are almost always done on two separate systems. The main workflow for many data scientists today is as follows:&#xA;1. Create and establish all hyper-parameters for a model such as a deep neural network &#xA;2. Train the deep neural network using a GPU&#xA;3. Save the weights that training on the GPU established so that the model can be deployed. &#xA;4. Code the model in a production application with the optimal weights found in training. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as you can see from this workflow training and inference are done in two completely separate phases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in some specific cases training and inference are done on the same system.

The hidden layers, you can have multiple layers all of different breadth (number of nodes per layer). The output layer depends on the number of classes in your dataset. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An easy example is applying a NN to the MNIST datatset.

And you will need 10 output nodes, one for each possible output. The hidden layers can be set in any way you can creatively imagine. There are however ways to optimize your hidden layer to get the best performance possible while not spending too much computational power. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is always how a NN works. The beauty of a NN is that you only need to code it once and it can learn any function. All you need to do is change your architecture, but the underlining principles will always be the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case, you want to do segmentation. This is often done using a window around the pixel you want to classify. Popular choices are 3*3 or 5*5 pixels. The choice of your considered window will determine the number of nodes in your input layer. Then you want to classify them as one of two classes, thus you need 2 output nodes. You can also use just 1, but I don't recommend it, I can expand on this if you care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One caveat of NN is that you will need quite a bit of training data. So get ready to classify a lot of pixels manually. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How to know how many layers in hidden layer? How to know how many nodes per layer in the hidden layer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, for simple operations like the one you are trying to learn you do not need to have multiple layers. One hidden layer should be enough, at most 2. But, how do you determine the number of nodes you should use? You need to use some model validation techniques to do this. One way is through grid search and cross-validation. Train, and re-train your model with multiple number of nodes and then compare their performances to identify the optimal number of nodes. To get good results this does require a large dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rule of thumb: 1 hidden layer for NN! Don't get dragged into deep models if you don't need them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5925" LastActivityDate="2017-03-09T15:34:17.910" CommentCount="0" />

It uses a local search technique to reduce the likelihood of the premature convergence. The cryptanalysis of simplified data encryption standard can be formulated as NP-Hard combinatorial problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to your question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since Memetic Algorithms are like Genetic Algorithms to some extent, but individual genomes are allowed to improve in-situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a classical genetic algorithm, an individual is a single static sample. Those samples are mixed together with crossover and the results are perturbed with mutations to get the next generations of static samples to test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the otherside,Memetic algorithms; the samples themselves are allowed to do a bit of hill-climbing over the individual’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example: Imagine evolving a neural network to perform some task, using a fixed structure and encoding the weights in the fixed-length genome. A genetic algorithm would test the networks, perhaps even allowing some learning, but the individual’s genome would always be the initial weights. and with an memetic algorithm, the learned weights are fed back into the genome before breeding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t see memetic algorithms as being very useful, nor are they biologically inspired. They require an unambiguous 1-to-1 genotype-phenotype mapping, which is all but useless except for fairly trivial tasks.

The limitation is that you have to be able to identify clear success and failure goals so as to clearly identify the successful parentage with which to start the next generation.  So, the most common uses involve complex situations (if they are simple situations then the ROI of building genetic algorithms to solve them isn't there) where there is lots of complex data as input and clear expected results to test success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other real-world examples or applicability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some examples that have a large potential input data set (with varying quality of the definition of successful results) are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weather prediction[this also involves learning past and current data]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market analysis (Stock prediction, crop prediction, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying patterns in data sets (audio, video, photos,&#xA;combinations, large datasets, etc.): facial recognition, movement&#xA;recognition, identifying specific works (which song is this, which&#xA;movie, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hacking (breaking codes, finding patterns in passwords, searching&#xA;through large memory dumps)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And lastly,Natural language recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope this can give a glimpse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1581" LastActivityDate="2017-03-17T12:06:01.073" CommentCount="1" />

Python is pretty much a standard with Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would recommend that, for C++ you can figure out the algorithm of what you want to code and design and still spend quite a bit of time getting the idioms right. Its gentler with Python. Aside from scripting game AI, I have not heard of Lua being used in &lt;strong&gt;Big Data&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Robotics&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robotics Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is implemented mostly in C++ with Python bindings almost always available for the different Robot Operating Systems, there are greater options with Python Lua will limit you.

So that means that everything works as a table, you have no different kind of variables like in other languages: integers, Strings…So you don’t have to be worried about making changes between types of data (I mean, for example, the parseInt used in Java is not necessary).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The code is not full of {}, so in my opinion it is a very good way to reduce programming elements in screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also object oriented.

The singularity (in this case superintelligent artificial general intelligence (AGI)) tends to have global consequences. In &lt;em&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies&lt;/em&gt; Bostrom elaborates on this idea. Essentially, there are three potential outcomes (keep in mind these are from a human perspective.):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Global positive&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Global negative&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Uneven outcomes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Global positive assumes the AGI has goals which align with human values (likely because we sorted out the control problem/alignment). The outcome here ranges between humans simply continuing to exist (maybe the AGI simply leaves) and humans receiving a cosmic endowment (utopian singularity stuff).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Global negative assumes the AGI does not have goals which align with human values (likely because we didn't sort out the control problem/alignment).The outcome here ranges from humans simply continuing to exist (again, the AGI may simply leave), to humans no longer existing (perhaps we are more useful to the unaligned AGI as paper clips).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The global outcomes appear to be significantly more likely due to the way we are approaching the control problem/alignment. Aligning an AGI with human goals in general is extremely difficult. Aligning an AGI with &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; human's goals implies total control over it, which is significantly more difficult. With that said, it may happen, which could lead to the third potential outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Uneven outcomes assume the control problem has been completely solved, and the AGI is perfectly aligned with a specific group of human's goals (to reiterate, this is &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; difficult to do, and is unlikely to happen.) In this scenario, the controlling group would have a decisive strategic advantage, receive a cosmic endowment, and would likely form a singleton. Perhaps they would share with others, perhaps they would turn everybody else into paper clips, who knows. On this path, groups which do not pursue AGI (perhaps for the reasons you listed) are taking an existential risk. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in general, it is unlikely things will go particularly well for one group while going badly for another, but if it does it may be quite bad for the losing groups. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6184" LastActivityDate="2017-03-22T15:49:48.790" CommentCount="0" />

ISA is based on independent component analysis (ICA)&#xA;  but &lt;strong&gt;relaxes the constraint that requires at least as many mixture observation signals as sources&lt;/strong&gt;. A&#xA;  second extension to ICA is the use of dynamic components to represent non-stationary signals.&#xA;  Sources are tracked by similarity of dynamic components over small time steps. We propose&#xA;  a method for grouping components by partitioning a matrix of independent component crossentropies&#xA;  that we call an ixegram. The ixegram measures the mutual similarities of components&#xA;  in an audio segment and clustering the ixegram yields the source subspaces and time trajectories.&#xA;  &lt;strong&gt;To demonstrate the techniques we give examples of ISA applied to separation of musical and&#xA;  speech sources from single-channel mixtures&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6026" LastEditorUserId="6026" LastEditDate="2017-03-22T17:55:53.663" LastActivityDate="2017-03-22T17:55:53.663" CommentCount="1" />

But the point is, ANN is only a ML algorithm, but absolutely a powerful one. You should be aware that there are random and multiple weight initializations in ANNs, and this means a fairly stochastic behavior of your network, which vanishes only in shallow networks with high amount of training data. Your network's specifications are even likely influenced by the order of feeding the instances in the training phase. So if what I think of the encryption/decryption process &quot;certain rules for message transformation&quot; is true, then a stochastic network is indeed a sophisticated option (but according to scientists in neural cryptography research area, completely possible)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're probably thinking of auto-encoding networks, one kind that maps &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and has a bottle neck, such that if successfully trained, it has developed the power of reducing the number of data features from say 10'000 to 500, and then successfully retrieving the original data with 10'000 features from that 500-features one; such that If I feed a new instance to a trained auto-encoding network, grab it in the bottle neck layer and send it to you, you must be able to feed the message to the bottle neck layer and receive the full decoded message from the output layer. However there's (always) a catch! and that is you need a really &quot;BIG&quot; dataset to train your deep network. Besides you cannot expect it to work well on every kind of data after being trained by a fixed amount. for example your network cannot successfully retrieve an image of a dog, if all you've fed in the training phase was cats' and lizards' images. So can you guarantee that new messages to be encoded have the same type as the ones in the training set?!

What I mean by is that the bots construct responses that are slowly and incrementally tuned according to the &lt;em&gt;overall&lt;/em&gt; usage of the chat bot, from &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; user. The bots are responding to &lt;em&gt;each message&lt;/em&gt; based on how a new user would expect them to. As Alan1 notes, &quot;Men are Man&quot;. It's making this response based solely off your single most recent message.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, you are looking for a bot who focuses moreso on persistent memory of the individual conversation. The problem here becomes you're now almost asking for a Natural Language Parser, a big problem many people are working on and something that's years away from existing as robustly as you suggest. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The chat bot not only has to recognize the words 'Socrates', 'Name', and 'Dog'; but that in this sentence, it's the dog's name that is Socrates. That's a lot of information to gain beyond just the words. Which is why from a server / implementation standpoint, the above method is also a lot easier to program (every message just query your server, no need to maintain state - that is, memory of the conversation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The chat bots can't possibly get enough information from one person to train how to speak and respond, so they 'crowd-source' that information for training. But that means that Clever Bot (or any similar caliber chat bot) won't respond in terms of parsing the meaning of what you're asking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking this even further, one can consider the notion of such a program being Turing-Complete. Supposing we had a chat bot like you're suggesting, we could perhaps show equivalence to a Turing-Machine, or even perhaps show we can do something like decide the halting problem. Off the top of my head I imagine the procedure being basically showing you would be able to decide halting given initial conditions. E.g. Given &quot;Socrates is a man&quot; and &quot;All men die&quot; can we decide if the chat bot will ever be able to deduce if Socrates dies? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll work on a formal proof from the latter and post it if it works out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1538" LastActivityDate="2017-03-31T21:39:47.073" CommentCount="3" />

You can notice that classical painting that tried to be photorealistic stopped to be relevant when photography started, and that several modern movements started, like more abstract paintings, surrealism, or cubism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One can see art as a medium to brag &quot;i'm better than you&quot;. They could say &quot;i'm better than you at perfecting realism technique&quot; until photography appeared. Now, on this aspect, what do artists brag about?Sometimes by claiming how progressive they are when sculpting sex toys?&#xA;By claiming that their white sphere is &quot;too deep for you&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not an art historian, though, this is how i feel it evolved to current modern &quot;art&quot; where skill has been replaced with provocation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Photography might be a good starting point to think about how people react to a technology that dwarves them and they still want to be #1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-- here's a point to note: people want to have a good identity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paul Lafargue once wrote The right to be lazy, where he argued how mankind would intellectually evolve if people worked less as machines could work for us. One of his argument was that people se sees as intellectual models, Greek philosophers, didn't work, and had more time to think.&#xA;I think he misses a point: not everyone is able to enjoy philosophical time spending.&#xA;Not unlike how we were deeply wrong when we expected internet to open our minds towards a great age of knowledge.&#xA;Remember that people are not utopically intelligent, that you have stupid people, and humans basically follow their instinctive needs.&#xA;This is why 20 years after we started using internet, we have lolcats, trolls, gated communities, and more intellectual intolerance (think sjw, alt right movements).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-- point #2: not everyone is able to be included in a &quot;everyone will be bright&quot; utopia&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key is one's identity. I think that everyone wants and need to have a &quot;positive identity&quot;, they look for one to compensate for their weaknesses.&#xA;This is, for me, why poorer people tend to show off, and successful people don't tend to brag.&#xA;So, how do you forge your positive identity when you don't have much for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see a few things that happen around me:&#xA;- be a rebel: to distinguish yourself, you become an opponent; but in fact you just mirror the main trend, while bragging about how independant you are. I'm opposed, so i'm free. You can have a range from IA free stance (like people who didn't want to use the internet, some of the ones who use free software), to a more aggressive movement.&#xA;- be conservative, pious: maybe in reaction to a society that changes and becomes too progressive for some, i see people becoming conservative, this is still a rebellious trend, and i see the rise of conservative vote (nationalism) or religion (buddhism, christianism, islam) as a reaction. I follow traditions, so i'm independant from your novelties. Religion is always a solid value when society changes.&#xA;- be hyperprogressive: same reaction as previous point if you think that society is too conservative. It's a rebellious stance when you have conservative people in front of you. I'm a step ahead everyone, look at how avant-gardiste i am.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-- point #3: if you don't excel in a field, be a rebel. Or: if you can't follow, step aside, don't follow the stream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you have no work to do anymore, plenty of food grown by IA controlled drones, all material needs fulfilled, and no interest in thinking too much.&#xA;What do people do when they have too much time?&#xA;Simple: they fill their natural urges that are not related to material needs and food.&#xA;Some examples: eating, playing games, having sex, arguing online, getting wasted. Basically everything that has been labelled as a sin.&#xA;You'll also have forms of mental disorders you see in people who feel worthless. And many more will feel worthless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This also means that you'll need more jobs to keep these people entertained, or taking care of the suffering ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-- point #4: if life gets too easy, people become sinners&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By these few examples, here rises a question: if &quot;mediocre&quot; people tend to get their shiny identity by opposing the mainstream society, how will the mainstream society look like after the rise of AI?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So i see three reactions from people:&#xA;- be relevant after AI's rise, the ones who can follow&#xA;- become a rebel, the ones who can't follow but still want to appear relevant&#xA;- be neutral, the ones who fill their human urges&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in general, people will do a mix of the three.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mankind, with the help of AI which can provide answers to basically anything, will provide new questions, new projects, new frontiers to explore. Many persons will still be a bit relevant.&#xA;AI will become mainstream, so everyone will be more or less opposing it, while enjoying its benefits (think about people who claim to be technology/money independant but have an iPhone).&#xA;People will still argue online and giggle at cute cats doing weird stuff. Maybe more, because they have more free time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, &lt;strong&gt;if AI becomes relevant, expect a world where more people have too much time on their hands&lt;/strong&gt;.&#xA;I find this conclusion a bit deceiving, after all I thought and wrote. :O&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6141" LastActivityDate="2017-04-03T10:29:29.440" CommentCount="0" />

I contemplate a AI system that automatically &quot;chains&quot; all these methods together in the most optimal way. The way I imagine this to work is by means of what I call &quot;a bag of functions&quot;. So, how would this work?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For each of the methods I use at the moment, I would specify their input requirements, and specify what they provide as output. (e.g.: input = reference, output = title). These could also be parameters like: input = year, output = is valid year? . Note that if a function outputs &quot;title&quot; that is &lt;em&gt;an attempt&lt;/em&gt; at providing the title, but this is not necessarily correct (if for example, the regex pattern grabbed a wrong portion of text).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For each of these functions, I would build a training set, and log their execution time (cost) and their probability of providing a correct result.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then, I would build a system that chains these functions together to get from a certain input, to a certain output. eg: from -a function that takes a reference, and outputs the list of co authors- to -a function that takes a list of co authors, and breaks it apart into separate authors- to -a function that takes an author, and tries to break it apart into last name and initial-.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once a &quot;chain&quot; of functions is found, this chain can in turn be stored as a &quot;function&quot; and can be reused later on by the algorithm. For each function, the success rate and run time is stored, so the algorithm can choose to go for the fastest known route, or experiment with new functions.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the settings you could specify the max run time (cost) or the minimum success rate. This way you could push the system to experiment with new combinations of functions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I explained the intent clearly, and I'm not sure the design would hold once I try to implement this in reality. Just wanted to throw this out here to see if anyone recognizes the design. This feels like a combination of a shortest path algorithm (to connect the functions) with normal statistical probability (to determine the success rate of a function) with a &quot;self learning&quot; system (because combinations of functions can be &quot;remembered&quot; and reused).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The added advantage would be that I don't need to manually guess what parsing method I should give a higher or lower likelihood of being correct in what specific scenario. It would allow me to just &quot;throw&quot; a new function into the bag, and let the system test it in all kinds of configurations, learning when best to use it, and when to avoid it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6451" LastActivityDate="2017-04-05T14:00:12.283" Title="Does this &quot;flavor&quot; of AI have a name?"

Emotions drive how we communicate and connect with each other, and impact our health and well-being. Human emotional intelligence (or your EQ) is our ability to recognize not only our own emotions but also those of other people, and to use emotions to guide our behaviour, adapt to different environments and achieve our goals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hint on today scenario&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, our lives play out in a digital world. We are surrounded by lots of hyper-connected systems, smart devices and advanced AI (artificial intelligence) systems. In other words, lots of IQ, but no EQ. That’s a problem, especially as our interactions with technology are becoming more conversational and relational. Just look at how we use our mobile devices and interact with intelligent agents such as Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. These technologies that are designed to interact with humans need emotional intelligence to be effective. Specifically, they need to be able to sense human emotions and then adapt their operation accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Affectiva, is on a mission to humanize technology with artificial emotional intelligence, or as I like to call it: Emotion AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might ask you're self what is this emotion AI in line with How far are we?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might also know this as emotion recognition technology. Our Emotion AI unobtrusively measures facial expressions of emotion. Using just a standard webcam, our technology first identifies a human face in real time or in an image or video. Computer vision algorithms identify key landmarks on the face — for example the corners of your eyebrows, the tip of your nose, the corners of your mouth. Machine learning algorithms then analyse pixels in those regions to classify facial expressions. Combinations of these facial expressions are then mapped to emotions. Now also using deep learning approaches, we can very quickly tune our algorithms for high performance and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Emotion AI uses massive amounts of data. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.affectiva.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Affectiva&lt;/a&gt; has built the world’s largest emotion data repository. it has analysed more than 5.2 million faces in 75 countries. That is really important because people around the world don’t look the same, and certainly express emotion differently when they go about their daily business “in the world”. In all this data being gathered, there are many very interesting aspects of human emotional behaviour. &lt;em&gt;Special thanks to MIT Labs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real world example based on data that is being studied in order to find pattern;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we all know women are more expressive than men. now data not only confirms that, it also shows that women smile more and that their smiles last longer. Then there are cultural differences: in the US women smile about 25% more, in France 40% more. The Spanish are more expressive than Egyptians, but apparently , Egyptians show more positive emotion. Data also detects notions of the polite smile seen in cultures such as Japan. In general, in more collectivist cultures, in group settings people dampen their emotions, but are very expressive when they are at home alone. In more individualistic cultures, such as North America and Europe, it’s the opposite, people are more expressive in group settings than when they are by themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glimpse on how emotion AI is applied today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over 1,400 brands are using this kind of technology to measure and analyse how consumers respond to digital content, such as videos and ads, and even TV shows. Emotion data helps media companies, brands and advertisers improve their advertising. Emotion AI also gets integrated into other technologies to make them emotion-aware. Now with Artificial Intelligence Software Developer Kit (SDK), any developer can embed Emotion AI into the apps, games, devices and digital experiences they are building, so that these can sense human emotion and adapt. This approach is rapidly driving more ubiquitous use of Emotion AI across a number of different industries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concerning the future[ &lt;strong&gt;Will computers be able to understand user emotions?&lt;/strong&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the future holds for Emotion AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answer is simple: it will be ubiquitous, engrained in the technologies we use every day, running in the background, making our tech interactions more personalized, relevant, authentic and interactive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However,innovation helps to predict what the future holds by basing on current developments for instance;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Robots such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cataliahealth.com/how-it-works/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mabu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://robotic.media.mit.edu/portfolio/tega/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tega&lt;/a&gt; are using Emotion AI to understand the moods and expressions of the people they interact with. In education, Emotion AI will understand if a student is frustrated or bored, but what if the learning content would adapt? The &lt;a href=&quot;http://littledragon.artha.hk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Little Dragon&lt;/a&gt; learning app is among the first of such adaptive apps designed to help children learn language in a more interactive and interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Video games are designed to take us on an emotional journey but do not change their gameplay based on the emotions of the player. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nevermindgame.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nevermind game&lt;/a&gt; changes that all around,this biofeedback thriller game gets more real and challenging as players show signs of distress.

The team at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brain-power.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Brain Power&lt;/a&gt; has built an autism program that is already changing the lives of families with children on the autism spectrum.

Taxi driving is a continuous state and continuous-time problem: the speed and location of the taxi and of the other vehicles sweep through a range of continuous values and do so smoothly over time.

There's one additional rule of thumb that helps for&#xA;  supervised learning problems. The upper bound on the number of hidden&#xA;  neurons that won't result in over-fitting is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;$$N_h = \frac{N_s} {(\alpha * (N_i + N_o))}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;$N_i$ = number of input neurons.    $N_o$ = number of output neurons. &#xA;  $N_s$ = number of samples in training data set.   $\alpha$ = an&#xA;  arbitrary scaling factor usually 2-10.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;                      &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solver.com/training-artificial-neural-network-intro&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Others recommend&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;  setting $alpha$ to a value between 5 and 10, but I find a value of 2&#xA;  will often work without overfitting. As explained by this &lt;a href=&quot;http://hagan.okstate.edu/NNDesign.pdf#page=469&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;excellent&#xA;  NN Design text&lt;/a&gt;, you&#xA;  want to limit the number of free parameters in your model (its&#xA;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/57027/15974&quot;&gt;degree&lt;/a&gt; or number of&#xA;  nonzero weights) to a small portion of the degrees of freedom in your&#xA;  data. The degrees of freedom in your data is the number samples *&#xA;  degrees of freedom (dimensions) in each sample or $N_s * (N_i + N_o)$&#xA;  (assuming they're all independent). So $\alpha$ is a way to indicate&#xA;  how general you want your model to be, or how much you want to prevent&#xA;  overfitting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For an automated procedure you'd start with an alpha of 2 (twice as&#xA;  many degrees of freedom in your training data as your model) and work&#xA;  your way up to 10 if the error for training data is significantly&#xA;  smaller than for the cross-validation data set.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And specificely on LSTM's, you might want to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4behuh/does_the_number_of_layers_in_an_lstm_network/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the main point - &lt;strong&gt;there is no rule of thumb for the amount of hidden nodes you should use, it is something you have to figure out case-specifically by trial and error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5344" LastActivityDate="2017-04-14T15:55:12.433" CommentCount="0" />

In the case of DL, it is worse! we do not even see what the selected and effective features are. I'm not a DL expert but as much as I know, DL's black box is darker! But knowledge bases are written in a human-friendly language. after a knowledge accumulation phase, you could see all the connections between the entities, and more important, you could interpret those connections. if you cut a wire in a knowledge base, your model will lose just a bit of its power, and you know what exactly it will lose; for example disconnecting the &quot;Pluto&quot; node from the &quot;solar system&quot; node, will tell your model what deGrasse Tyson told us. but in a ML model, this might turn it into a pure useless one: what happens if you manipulate the connection between the neuron number 14 and 47 in a NN model used to predict which planets belong to the solar system?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ML models are merely an inscription of the data. They do not have the power of inference, and they don't give you one. knowledge base is on the other hand capable of inference from the prior knowledge as you indicated in your question. It is shown that DL models that have been trained with say image classification data, could also be applied to voice detection problem. But this doesn't mean DL models could apply its prior knowledge in the domain of images to the domain of voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need kilos of data for traditional ML algorithms and tons of data for DL ones. but a single instance of a dataset will create a meaningful knowledge base for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two main research topics in NLP: machine translation and question answering. Practically it has been shown that DL works significantly with machine translation problems but acts kind of stupid in question answering challenge, specially when the domain of topics covered in the human-machine conversation is broad. Knowledge bases are no good choice for machine translation but are probably the key to a noble question answering machine.

This is just a fancy word for the calculations that AI perform to compare profit and loss of taking certain decision. I have considered that you are are talking about a General Intelligence. There is always a tight analogy between a General Intelligence and a human. You can juxtapose the utility function to how we take decisions by considering marginal profits of doing something over the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Now your question: &lt;br&gt;&#xA;The answer is a big &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;. This is because an AI (or a human) never takes an action that gives a low score on its utility function or is against the fundamental view of the machine (or human). &lt;em&gt;AI only cares about the utility function and goal state (plus the instrumental goals), nothing else&lt;/em&gt;. Our AI outside the box has been created with the purpose of not opening the box. For it, the action of opening the box has a very low score, or a negative score.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Now you might be wondering why an AI can’t be convinced of doing something that gives a low score in its utility function. Keep reading&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Consider this for a second. Suppose an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) was created, assigned with the task of copying the handwriting of others and improving its own writing. You can think of it as a smart writing hand. Now what this AI might come up with is that in order to practice writing it needs more pages and thus it needs to cut more trees for that. No matter what you do, AI will not stop from cutting more and more trees. It might even replicate itself into machines that will cut trees for him. Now, the only thing that can be done is to turn off the AGI. But, a smart machine would have known the possibility of being turned off and thus will have transferred itself to many other machines over the globe. The important question to ask here is, why it is doing all this? It is not because the machine wants to live, as we humans want to. The only reason why it wants to live is to fulfil its goal.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You simply can’t change the fundamental view of the machine. The change can result in, the machine not able to attain its goal or not to that extend (optimal profit). This is the reason why you can’t convince a machine to do something that it was asked not to do as its primary task.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;You, as a person, are living a life now, and have some fundamental beliefs. Let us consider that you believe in not killing someone. Now, suppose that I give you a pill and tell you that after taking this pill it will rewire your brain and you will kill first four people you see. But after that you will achieve pure satisfaction and happiness. Now you will definitely not take that pill as it conflicts will something that you believe in now. Also, you will try your best and fight back not to take that pill. The same thing applies to a General Intelligence too. It doesn’t matter what your future version will feel or attain after rewiring of the brain (changes in code), it is what and who you are now matters.

This is because sometimes we don’t know the optimal way of solving certain problems. In the case of your question, we don’t know what these two machines will do or say to each other.

These fundamental elements are called (generally) subatomic particles and are anything but discrete values. In quantum field theory, the more accurate you are able to measure position, the less accurate you may know a quarks momentum (and vice versa). Our world, at the most fundamental layer, is probabilistic when observed. This is all not to say that an understanding of quantum mechanical kinematic descriptions is the only methodology to achieve true AGI, but to say probabilistic models, and therefore uncertainty, is a dead-end seems radically inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, Dr.Minsky didn't really feel probabilistic models were dead ends.

If you are unaware, connectionism is the concept of creating models around discrete units of representation (neurones in a neural net for example). You see the problem we have identified isn't that probabilistic models are inaccurate, it's that our current approach doesn't express the biological realism necessary for AGI (although sufficient for specific intelligence).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[I briefly worked with Dr.Minsky at the AI Lab before his passing last year, a hilarious man and brilliant scientist.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5839" LastActivityDate="2017-04-29T17:46:16.563" CommentCount="1" />

I do not know of any way currently where different frame sizes can be inputted directly into the neural network, as in order to do that you would need to almost completely change the neural network architecture. If the frames have a small difference in size, you may be able to get away with scaling the frame to the dimensions of the largest frame. This also depends upon what kind of problem you are trying to solve. While this method would work if you are trying to classify an image into a couple categories, it would not work if your are trying to do tasks such as object location. If you are doing one of the latter tasks, you should be able to pad the image with blank pixels in order to make the frame you are trying to process the dimensions of the largest one. This would work quite well, especially for object location detection. Finally, another solution is to crop the larger images to the size of the smallest one. While this will work just as well as padding, if you need any image data from the very edges of the frame, this will not work very well. So in conclusion, there are three different methods you could apply. Me personally, I would go with padding because it does not remove any important image data, and it will work very well for tasks such as object location detection. If you are doing a classification task though, scaling would work also. Finally, you could crop the images, but this would have to be evaluated for your specific task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4631" LastActivityDate="2017-04-29T18:51:45.553" CommentCount="0" />

Given that we don't really know what it means to 'understand' something, and that even the meaning of 'meaning' itself is by no means a resolved issue, it might be overly specific.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In one strand of linguistics, the meaning of a word is defined by its use, and by the context of surrounding words. We could hazard a guess that children acquire the meaning of words through exposure to language, and the correlation of experiences with the corresponding sounds. How that works in detail is AFAIK not fully understood. But there would be nothing 'inherent' in a new-born human that would enable it to 'understand' anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that is the case, then we could train a machine to do the same. Obviously, it would be a long and tedious process, and there is probably a reason why it takes us years to become proficient in our use of language. But if we correlate sensory input with linguistic utterances, a sufficiently sophisticated learning algorithm might be able to acquire some meaning for such utterances from the way they are used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, rather a lot of unknowns here. That is because the topic straddles various fields, from child language acquisition, corpus linguistics, the psychology of learning, and many more. And to my knowledge, none of these fields is sufficiently advanced to shed any light on this issue yet. There is the whole question of abstract words and concepts. How do we segment the continuous stream of sounds into discrete units (&lt;em&gt;phonemes&lt;/em&gt;) without knowing what they are?

A properly set up machine, which would be able to simulate human learning, would pick up its own mapping of linguistic structures to its experience from the world outside.

You also have to keep in mind that too few kernels could possibly lose information and overfit to specific patterns, while too many kernels could possibly underfit.

I'm having trouble in conceptually understanding how they succeed in doing regression (i.e. predicting continuous variables), however, and wondered if anybody has a good explanation. I know the mathematics of how NNs work, but a clearer conceptual understanding would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To give an idea of what I mean by a &quot;conceptual understanding&quot;, here's the one that I have for how multilayer NN's with a sigmoid activation function are able to be effective classifiers. Each NN takes the scalar product of its inputs and a set of weights. The weights define a plane in the input space, and the sign of the scalar product indicates which side of the plane the point defined by the inputs is on. The sigmoid activation function outputs 1 if the point is on one side and 0 or -1 (depending on which function is used) if the point is on the other. So the first hidden layer of neurons can be considered to identify which side of each of a group of planes the input point is on. The neurons can also act as AND and OR gates, so subsequent layers of neurons give an output indicating whether the point lies in a region bounded by several of the planes (e.g. a neuron activates only if the point is above one plane and below another, indicating it is in a region of the space associated with one class of points). So if the network learns an appropriate set of planes to bound regions containing different classes of inputs and the AND/OR relations that determine whether a point is in a given region, then it can classify the input points, and this can work for regions with arbitrarily shaped boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've not found or been able to think of a similar way of explaining why an NN can perform well in general regression problems (if it's big enough).

As you can see, all the above ASI are of collaborative nature. Either they are collaborating with humans or they need to collaborate with other systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now to your answer:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;First, collaborative nature is of great use in terms of &lt;em&gt;efficiency and performance&lt;/em&gt;. This is the reason why &lt;strong&gt;Distributed Systems&lt;/strong&gt; are being made. We even have distributed OS now. Also, Modular approach in coding/ developments and huge success of &lt;em&gt;Object Oriented Model&lt;/em&gt; are proofs of advantages of using collaboration among different entities.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you think about it even the AGI is collaborating and using resources from other places in some way. As your AGI is learning, it is gaining information from the internet. It reads the information and tries to structure is accordingly (This will depend on its neural schema) and &lt;em&gt;create knowledge&lt;/em&gt; (or something valuable) for itself. It is collaborating using network protocols with the outer world (other systems). If it doesn't collaborate then the firewall of the system might not allow it to use the service. Different services on the internet require a different set of protocols to be followed. So, if AGI wants to communicate for information it needs to follow those protocols. This way the AGI will learn to collaborate with different entities even at an early stage.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;From AGI point of view communicating a web server and communicating another AGI machine is very similar. As we, humans, don't store all the information in our brain; similarly AGI won't find it efficient to store all the information within. Not all information is needed all the time. The &lt;strong&gt;memory hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt; is proof of that. Even if AGI is made to store all the information within, with time it will figure out how inefficient it is and will re-program itself to only hold very vital information and use the internet for less frequently used information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I will like to add one more thing to this. Let us begin with the human analogy first. We, as humans, collaborate with other humans. But we also collaborate with our different body parts. Like, what about the collaboration within us. Collaboration (or coordination) between our legs, hands, our body, and mind, etc. This leads us to the question of who as a person we are, our whole body, or just our brain. If I remove my hand and replace it with an organic implant, would I be still me?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Similarly, what is AGI? Is it the whole structure, or just the code. Does the RAM, ROM, hard disks also a part of AGI? If you think the hardware is not the part of AGI then your AGI is co-ordinating with these devices too, using certain protocols. To some level, this is collaboration too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3005" LastActivityDate="2017-05-11T07:27:54.420" CommentCount="0" />

Selfishness vs generosity of the system - this is quite easy to define as sacrificing resources for &quot;own maintenance&quot; vs &quot;statutory purposes&quot; - &quot;helping others&quot; defined as fulfilling the role assigned by the creators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is all a matter of developing the goal function that gives sufficient priority to immediate or short term results. In the classic example of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;paperclip maximizer&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, without this sort of restriction the end result will be not even a single paper clip made, as the AI expands self to develop even more efficient way to create the paper clips, since current, inferior methods will waste resources which could better serve later, more advanced methods - the classic paradigm &quot;better is the enemy of good&quot;, all focus on optimizing the process without actually performing the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that we don't know what type of function the improvement due to the optimization process will follow, and so we don't quite know what sort of prioritization function to apply. Probably a flat deadline would work, but if that is movable, AI might sacrifice all resources to developing a way to move the deadline. Be it by resetting system clock, terrorizing system operators into adjusting the deadline, or inventing time travel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, selfishness vs generosity is a matter of developing the correct time constraints on the goal function. Difficult, but doable - without it AI will be &quot;infinitely selfish&quot;, but over-constrained, it will be inefficient, producing inferior immediate result instead of developing better. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Probably, a good approach would be to predict a reasonable (both achievable and desirable) advancement path and set this as the goal value - not maximization of output, but approaching the desired output value (which may be growing over time, linearly or exponentially) and freeing up unused resources - adding a cap on expansion speed. That would avoid the paperclip universe horror scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, for love. Again, this depends largely on the goal function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Defining love, that would be a specific mental state, influenced by specific hormones, and leading to specific re-shuffling of priorities, often resulting in impaired judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Defined that way, could AI love? Yes. Should it? uh, better no. Because, &quot;What will be the limit to love? Any theoretical limit?&quot; - about none, bar using up all matter and energy in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Love pretty much unconditionally favors the &quot;beloved&quot;. And that is just another phrasing for &lt;em&gt;maximization&lt;/em&gt;. And, as we all know, an unconstrained maximizer AI is bad news. You don't want &quot;Give you the Moon and all the stars&quot; to be a completely literal expression. So, love - while possible both to implement, and to happen as a side effect of poorly constrained other goals (like &quot;learn to feel all that a human can feel&quot;) can be a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yeah, regarding AI and love: can we?

License plates are unique thus feeding the entire plate into a machine learning algorithm would not yield very accurate results. First, you will want to make sure that the extracted license plate images are similar in size. Then you will want to separate the license plate such that you can separate the different digits and letters into their own respective images. Thus your dataset that will be used to train your network will consists of many single character images which contain either a letter or a digit. When you have finished training your model, future license plates will also have to be broken down in this way, classified and then the outputs be combined to get the license plate number.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a neural network?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A neural network (NN)&lt;/strong&gt; is a series of nodes which contain a simple, continuous, differentiable function such as logistic regression. Alone these nodes are not very powerful, however, the beauty comes in when they are connected in networks. The tuning of such a network can learn highly complex functions. Typically, a NN is set up with three layers. &lt;strong&gt;The input layer&lt;/strong&gt;, where you will feed in your features, &lt;strong&gt;the hidden layer&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;output layer&lt;/strong&gt;. Naturally, if you want a &lt;strong&gt;deep NN&lt;/strong&gt; then you just need to add more hidden layers. But, there is a trap. The deeper your network is the harder it will be to train, thus you will need MORE data. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The input-layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where you will be feeding in your images. If you have a 16*16 pixel image then you will have 256 input nodes. This layer typically does not perform any function on the input, it is simply taking in the input. It will then feed the input to the hidden layer. You can use some dimensionality reduction techniques to try and eliminate some useless information from your dataset such as the white spaces in the corner of the image. The less input nodes you have, the more informative your samples become, thus with higher information entropy your network will be able to learn faster, or more rigidly with the same amount of data. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hidden layers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are free here to choose how many layers you want and how many nodes you want in each layer. I suggest using &lt;strong&gt;grid search&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;cross-validation&lt;/strong&gt; as a means to determine which configuration is ideal for your dataset. Too many layers and nodes and you will not end up with a fully trained networks once you run out of training data (too much bias). Too little nodes, your network will not be able to learn the subtleties which are embedded within the data (too much variance). You want to find yourself at the crossroad where these two are minimized. Choose wisely. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The output layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This layer can be configured in a few different ways. Typically people like to do one output node for each class. In your case there are 26 letters in the alphabet and 10 digits. This gives 36 possible output classes. So you will need 36 nodes in your output layer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I train this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The training of the NN is by tuning the weights that will be applied to the inputs of each of your nodes. Try to draw your dense network, for each line connecting nodes you will have a weight. I am sure you can see how this becomes quite huge. You will &lt;strong&gt;initialize your weights randomly&lt;/strong&gt; to start. Then you will take each of your examples and pass them through your network. This is called a &lt;strong&gt;feed-forward&lt;/strong&gt; pass through. This will provide you with an output. You will compare your output with your ground truth value using a &lt;strong&gt;cost function&lt;/strong&gt;. This is often the &lt;strong&gt;root mean squared error (RMSE)&lt;/strong&gt; but there are many other options. Then using the derivative you will &lt;strong&gt;back-propagate&lt;/strong&gt; the error through your network to see which weights caused the error and to what extent. The derivative will then allow you to update those weights proportionately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WOW do I need to program all that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nope not anymore!!! You can use &lt;strong&gt;Keras in python&lt;/strong&gt; (my recommendation) or other similar frameworks which have made it a real tea sipping pleasure to program a variety of NN configurations. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would start with a simple NN and see what kind of accuracy I can achieve. From there I would try to use convolutional neural networks which have been shown to garner much better results on datasets comprised of images. These can also be implemented in Keras. CNN require more data than typical NN thus you might need to get access to more images.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is always best to train your dataset only on images you have in your original data. However, when it comes to images, adding to your data by artificially shifting images by 1-5 pixels or rotating by 1-5 degrees can add variability which can supplement your original data. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that the license plate pictures you are using to train your network are taken with a similar system as the images you will be using in the future. You will not get very good results if you train your network on images taken directly behind cars and then you expect to implement your solution in traffic cameras monitoring traffic from above. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5925" LastActivityDate="2017-05-15T13:27:20.490" CommentCount="7" />

Our learned algorithms, implemented by LSTMs, outperform generic, hand-designed competitors on the tasks for which they are trained, and also generalize well to new tasks with similar structure. We demonstrate this on a number of tasks, including simple convex problems, training neural networks, and styling images with neural art.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can find the related Github's repository &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deepmind/learning-to-learn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I still haven't found the time to read the paper to explain the details of these apparently interesting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2444" LastActivityDate="2017-05-16T00:47:23.113" CommentCount="1" />

For your task there are two sensible scenarios: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have a fixed reaction for danger and a fixed reaction for food and you only have to learn how to distinguish between them. In that case you basically try to classify the situation to trigger the right fixed response and this classification would be learned by &lt;a href=&quot;http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;backpropagation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You directly learn to act for a given situation.

You would randomly initialise your network, let it run around in the environment and remember how much food it ate and how often or how quickly it died. Then you would randomly change the weights of your network and do the same thing again. If it did better this time around you would proceed to use the new weights otherwise you go back to the old weights and try a different random change. &#xA;By selecting successful random changes it would over time learn to avoid danger and seek out food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: To my mind you have a fundamental misunderstanding how perception works. If you see a lion and a cake, do those trigger different kinds of cells on your retina? No! All nerve cells are used to detect all kinds of objects! The classification, i.e. whether you are seeing a lion or a cake happens in the neural network i.e. in the higher regions of your visual cortex, far removed from the initial nerve activation. Your lion might be yellow and your cake might be yellow, only if you analyse the high level structure of your nerve inputs can you decide what you are seeing. That is the task of a neural network. And that high level structure analysis is what a neural network learns. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What seems to confuse you is the example you linked. In that example this very sparse distance measuring is enough to differentiate between walls and boosters in your high level structure analysis, because the different points of the walls that you sample have a certain relative position that you can analyse and conclude that they constitute the wall. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your scenario very sparse distance measuring will not help you obviously. The distance of an object doesn't tell you whether it's a lion or a cake. Distance and color would be a solution to that. Or, more realistically, you have different shapes and much tighter distance sampling, and high level analysis can work out the shape from a couple of closely measured distances. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2227" LastEditorUserId="2227" LastEditDate="2017-05-26T07:09:30.393" LastActivityDate="2017-05-26T07:09:30.393" CommentCount="9" />

Some malicious software are viruses, worms, wabbits, trojanhorses, exploits, backdoors, spyware, scumware, stealware, parasiteware, adware, rootkits, keyloggers, dialers, hoaxes. It is important to be aware that however all of them have similar purpose but each one behave differently. Due to different behavior of different malwares, each malware group uses different alternative to remain undetected.And Antivirus software require improvisation to counter attack such viruses for computer protection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here comes wannacry which is called ransomware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is ransomware?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ransomware is a particularly nasty type of malware that blocks access to a computer or its data and demands ransom money to unblock your data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;WannaCry ransomware virus attack is definitely one of the worst digital disasters to strike in years, increasingly it appears that the hackers behind it were amateurs. The attack happens on Friday, 12 May 2017, a large cyber-attack using it was launched, infecting more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries, and demanding ransom payments. The attack has been done by multiple methods, including phishing emails, doc, pdf, shopping website and on unpatched systems as a computer worm&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a computer is infected from the ransomware, it typically contacts a central server to activate the information, and then begins encrypting files on the infected computer with that information. Once all the files are encrypted, it posts a message asking for payment to decrypt the files/data – and threatens to destroy the information if they doesn’t get paid, often with a timer attached to ramp up the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The so-called WannaCry is based on a security vulnerability in older versions of Microsoft Windows, which is still run on many medical devices today. The Windows flaw was discovered by the National Security Agency years ago, and publicized recently after hackers got a hold of the NSA files. The worm is a form of “ransomware” that infects computers and computer networks, locking down critical files until the victim agrees to pay a ransom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to your question&lt;/strong&gt;;&#xA;Can AI stop attacks like WannaCry?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now lets imagine that we have a programmed a Smart Anti-Virus or closest to  anti-virus with AI, and is regarded to be a virus scanner which use heuristics to detect malware.And this scenario i will call anti-virus with AI as &lt;strong&gt;Smart Anti-Virus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is this smart Anti-virus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Smart Anti-Virus is one that can detect malware that has got capabilities of stopping its activities when a system scan is going on.Even if a virus has taken control of the system,here i don't mind much which type of system or old version or current, it can be programmed to detect and avoid typical virus attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So main task of this Smart Anti-virus would be; to analyse,scan,detect, prevent, terminate and also protecting it's self from harm. So any AI it possesses is likely to be directed at that goal. To use its intelligence effectively, here are AI techniques which can be applied in antivirus detection;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a virtual environment the antivirus software classifies sequences or features by their behavior by allowing them. This new detection is more effectual in inspecting system information, including system file, and diagnosing which kind of malware is infected by differentiating with the traditional methods.

This gives the scanners time to decompile and study&#xA;them, and come up with new counterattacks that were not anticipated&#xA;by the virus writers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing the game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think of the cat-and-mouse operations of scanner and virus like a game.

Computer viruses need to be lightweight and nimble little pieces of code that slip into and out of systems and avoid detection.

It could use the intelligence of the whole network to prevent the takeover of any one of its hosts. Theoretically that could work, at least for a while, under present-day conditions.

The trouble starts with the smart virus starts evolving out of control at superfast speed. Soon the virus evolves into a civilization as smart as human but with machine speed and reflexes. And of course they try to take over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This book was interesting in depicting the smart viruses as evolving into distinct characters with different goals and personalities, but retaining a machine perspective. So I would recommend that and the rest of the series too, if you're a fan of sci-fi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problems with this scenario are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There probably is no such thing as out-of-control evolution at the speeds depicted in the book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's unrealistic to imagine a Russian teenager whipping up a virus&#xA;that displays more intelligence and adaptability than the rest of the&#xA;world combined, even if he does happen to know about biology.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even as viruses get smarter, overall security gets smarter too, so a&#xA;smart virus of the future may face a mathematically impenetrable wall&#xA;of security that no virus could get through with any amount of&#xA;smarts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this way, anti-virus efforts are not like a game, because we don't have to create a playing field that the smart virus could actually win.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Therefore,I would conclude by saying AI can stop or prevent malware,but in near future,there is a possibility that even malware can become artificially intelligent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1581" LastActivityDate="2017-05-19T09:49:21.680" CommentCount="0" />

It all comes down to parallelization.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Basically there are 2 ways to do it: model parallelization or batch parallelization.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Model parallelization is when you split the model by layers among multiple GPUs. As per my best knowledge you can't split a layer between GPUs, so 8 GPUs would serve 8 layers that is very extensive. Tensorflow supports this method. In my opinion more than 6 doesn't make sense this way.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Batch parallelization is when you run the entire model on each GPU parallel and you split your batch and process it in parallel. This is done via a trick to define a larger batch that will be split and become the desired batch size after split. In this case batch splitting and updating the weights is done on the CPU (in case of Tensorflow) and after 3 GPU any additional GPU has only a marginal improvement on training speeds (as per reports).

Probably you can do things like this to utilize DGX-1 but as far as I know Tensorflow doesn't support splitting a layer to multiple GPUs. My conclusion is that it's already very hard to utilize 8 GPUs and above that bus speed becomes the bottleneck.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extension:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I double checked on the bus speed and I was wrong, it should not be a problem. Most of the time consumed in training is computational effort of backpropagation.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually PCIe speed is limited by the CPU and the mobo chipset. The CPU has PCIe lanes to be allocated by the mobo. The strongest single CPU at the moment is Broadwell-E with 40 lanes (Skylake rumored to have 44). Mobo allocates that bandwidth either x16 or x8 to PCIe peripherals. So with a 40-lane CPU you can run 2 cards at x16 (2 * 16 = 32 &amp;lt; 40) or 5 cards at x8 (5 * 8 = 40). Here it needs to be mentioned that M.2 also uses PCIe lanes so for the latter option forgot and M.2 drive. A single CPU system will not take 8 GPUs, that's why they need dual CPU in DGX-1. The next limitation is the mobo chipset. The most powerful at the moment is the X99 and the C6 series. X299 will be announced next week if memory serves and probably a C6 replacement follows soon.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since PCIe speed is not the bottleneck in machine learning the updated answer for your question would be the more GPUs the better. It seems the limit is 5 at x8 using PCIe 3.0, but more than that is rarely needed since layers can't be split between GPUs. (And the deepest NN that still makes sense may be considered as 5-6 layers.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7364" LastEditorUserId="7364" LastEditDate="2017-05-24T19:44:28.630" LastActivityDate="2017-05-24T19:44:28.630" CommentCount="2" />

So you have three sets of 10 nerves in total transmitting to your input layer (30 neurons) and each nerve set senses either R, G, or B. If you set up your system so that there are three &quot;objects&quot; to collide with, stacked on top of each other (like a single object), your neural network will be capable of handling objects differently based on their RGB color value, meaning it can now handle nearly infinite &quot;types&quot; of objects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7249" LastActivityDate="2017-05-25T15:20:31.780" CommentCount="0" />

It's backed by Google. Love it or hate it, it's a Python based framework. There are many other Python based frameworks, as well. Scikit-learn, Theano, Keras are frequently mentioned in tutorials too. (A tip: if you use Windows you can download WinPython that includes all of these frameworks.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for about Java frameworks, unfortunately there are not so many options. The most prominent Java framework for DL is Deeplearning4j. It's developed by a small company and its user base is much smaller then the crowd around TensorFlow. There are fewer projects and tutorials for this framework. However, industry specialists say Java based frameworks eventually integrate better with Java based Big Data solutions and they may provide a higher level of portability and easier product deployment. Just a sidenote: NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory used Deeplearning4j for many projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you decide to go with the flow and want to start learning more about TensorFlow, I recommend you to check out the YouTube channels of &quot;DeepLearning.TV&quot;, &quot;sentdex&quot; and &quot;Siraj Raval&quot;.

And since I don't know what type of analysis you wish to achieve, I'll also assume that you are attempting a classification problem, or something similar to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Which are the recommended kind of algorithm to do this ( Neural network, genetic algorithm, etc)? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most general approach is to select a &lt;strong&gt;supervised learning/classification algorithm&lt;/strong&gt; and have it learn the function or type of analysis you wish to achieve by training it with known examples of data patterns. By this, I mean, select an algorithm capable of mapping or classifying unknown web logs or tracking data patterns to a predefined set of categories. These categories might be time spent, scrolling, visits per page, visits per user, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those categories are probably the basics, and they could easily be done manually. So for a more in depth process you could attempt analysing any correlations in the data by utilising an approach similar to bagging. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bagging or bootstrap aggregating&lt;/strong&gt; is a type of algorithm used in &lt;strong&gt;ensemble learning&lt;/strong&gt;. Ensemble learning refers to the approach of applying or using multiple algorithms to achieve better predictive/classification performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bagging relies on the process of obtaining replicas of the training data set (web logs, tracking data, etc.) and training the classifiers on these replicas.&#xA;So essentially,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different training data subsets are obtained randomly from the entire&#xA;training dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each training data subset is used to train a different classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Individual classifiers are then combined by taking a simple majority&#xA;vote of their decisions, where the chosen majority vote    results in&#xA;the ensemble decision.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With trying to identify any correlation between page visits. Take a sufficiently large population of size N - large enough to ensure that any form of sampling and resampling from the population does not repeatedly result in any substantial overlaps. &#xA;From the population, sample a subset of it, train a classifier on this subset sample, resample the population by replacing the log visits in the previous subset with new log visits from the population, and train again. Repeat this process for all the classifiers in the ensemble with different subset samples. Eventually, each classifier should determine their own correlation or measurable trait regarding the log vists in the population. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ensemble algorithm then determines what this correlation or measurable trait is by considering the majority classification determined by the classifiers composing the ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hint&lt;/strong&gt; ;So simply,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Identify what you are trying to measure or analyse.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generate data for training in which that measurable trait can be&#xA;discovered.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specify the measurable trait as a parameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select a number of sufficiently similar supervised learning&#xA;algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Train each of these algorithms on the training data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If successful, identify or define more parameters and just repeat&#xA;the above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;what is the best language to make this AI?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/logtools&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;python library&lt;/a&gt; for log file analysis.And also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scala-lang.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; for pattern matching inline with recognition,functional programming and strong for static type system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I think the key step is defining or redefining this problem as a supervised learning problem and going from there.&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;also have a look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9086/server-log-analysis-using-machine-learning&quot;&gt;logs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1581" LastEditorUserId="1581" LastEditDate="2017-05-29T11:09:38.457" LastActivityDate="2017-05-29T11:09:38.457" CommentCount="0" />

That would imply different network architectures for different states, which would imply optimizing several different networks. Unless you used some convoluted approach like Net2Net to keep the networks synced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;However, you can bypass the network itself.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can, however, on top of the network, filter its outputs. Let's say you have a set of states, and in state X, only 2 out of all 5 actions are valid. When getting the Q-values for all the actions in DQN, you can detect if you're in state X, and instead of choosing the greedy action out of all actions, choose the greedy action out of all &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt; actions. Better yet, have your environment just send a list of all valid actions for whatever state you're in. Makes this more general, as it removes your need for discrete states, having lists of valid actions for each state, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;You can also really just ignore invalid actions.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You claimed&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;However, ignoring them would imply returning the same state and a 0 reward, the best possible outcome, which is clearly not the case. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your environment has &lt;strong&gt;no time limit&lt;/strong&gt;, then the best action really is to stand still and avoid wasting resources. However, if there is a time-limit, eventually the agent should receive some sort of penalty for not completing the task. Otherwise, if there is no time limit, you can also give him an award for completing the task.

Write a program that keeps track of the remaining goals so that it doesn't get stuck considering only one possible operation when others will eventually lead to the goal. &lt;strong&gt;HINT:&lt;/strong&gt; have &lt;code&gt;achieve&lt;/code&gt; take an extra argument indicating the goals that remain to be achieved after the current goal is achieved. &lt;code&gt;achieve&lt;/code&gt; should succeed only if it can achieve the current goal and also &lt;code&gt;achieve-all&lt;/code&gt; the remaining goals.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Description of given functions:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;achieve&lt;/code&gt; :We input a goal, the list of operators, and the current state, in the &lt;code&gt;achieve&lt;/code&gt; function, which checks if the goal is in the &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; already, if not, then checks if the goal is recursive, if not, then finds all the &lt;code&gt;appropriate&lt;/code&gt; operators and then applies them, until the goal os achieved.

Now for the long answer: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As stated by the so called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;No free lunch theorem&lt;/a&gt;: regardless of the algorithm you use, you cant get learning &quot;for free&quot;(i.e by just looking at the training examples). The reason for this is that the only thing you know about the data is based on the limited examples you have seen in the training set. To &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization_error&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;generalize&lt;/a&gt;, your algorithm has to make some sort of assumptions about the underlying nature of the dataset and the manner in which it can be represented/interpreted. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Built into every algorithm is a set of assumptions about the dataset, for example, built into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;convolution neural network&lt;/a&gt; is the assumption that the dataset(e.g images you are using to train your Convolution neural network) can be understood by mimicking how the human eye is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw5PKV9Rj3o&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;known to work&lt;/a&gt;(i.e a bias). Some algorithms may have such strong biases such that they are incapable of learning certain kinds of functions.

Can it work in this case too? But remember I have different types of pieces, say A, B, C and D. Should I use 2x4 input matrices? It seem very sparse and of little efficiency to me. I fear it will be way too sparse for the convolutional layers to work.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I thought that the output could be a distribution of probabilities over the matrix representing board positions, plus a separate array of probabilities indicating what piece to play. However, I also need to represent the ability to &lt;strong&gt;pass&lt;/strong&gt; the turn, which is very important. How can I do it without diluting its significance among other probabilities?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;most importantly&lt;/strong&gt;, do I enforce winning moves only or losing moves too? Enforcing winning moves is easy because I just set desired probabilities to 1. However when losing, what can I do? Set that move probability to 0 and all the others to the same value? Also, does it make sense to enforce moves by the final score difference, even though this would go against the meaning of the outputs, which are roughly probabilities?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, I developed the game engine in node.js thinking to use Synaptic as framework, but I am not sure it can work with convolutional networks (I doubt there's a way to fix the weights associated to local perceptive fields).

The network will output different letters every activation based on the previous outputs (the LSTM model has some kind of memory).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This solution is kind of hard to explain, but if you provide me with a small list of peptide sequences (not too long, and not too much), then i'll make a working online example of you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As promised, I made simple implementation of solution 2.

Firstly, and most importantly, please understand that the general problem that the  OP is grappling with is not new nor confined to &lt;strong&gt;machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;, but rather the other way around, where machine learning is a set of techniques and methods that are being brought to bear on a larger problem of model creation and performance measurement. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;All models have error&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to that end, I introduce one of the most important quotes that one should learn and live by if interested in this domain. IMHO, the simplest form of this concept by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Professor Box&lt;/a&gt; (the creator of the &lt;strong&gt;Box&lt;/strong&gt; plot!) is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this is essentially true of &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; models. They are all necessary simplifications of what we encounter in real world data. All models are built from observation and compilation of experimental data, what we can label as &lt;em&gt;training data&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; are subject to failure once they are tested against additional data points, especially those that fall outside of the observed set included in the training data. This does not necessarily make them not useful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original quote from Box is more elaborate in making this point:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Now it would be very remarkable if any system existing in the real world could be exactly represented by any simple model. However, cunningly chosen parsimonious models often do provide remarkably useful approximations. For example, the law PV = RT relating pressure P, volume V and temperature T of an &quot;ideal&quot; gas via a constant R is not exactly true for any real gas, but it frequently provides a useful approximation and furthermore its structure is informative since it springs from a physical view of the behavior of gas molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For such a model there is no need to ask the question &quot;Is the model true?&quot;. If &quot;truth&quot; is to be the &quot;whole truth&quot; the answer must be &quot;No&quot;. The only question of interest is &quot;Is the model illuminating and useful?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is reminding us that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ideal gas equation&lt;/a&gt; is such a &lt;em&gt;theorectical, derived&lt;/em&gt; model and that, indeed, it fails to predict accurately 100% of the &lt;em&gt;real-word&lt;/em&gt; data points that are observed. It is, also, &lt;strong&gt;incredibly&lt;/strong&gt; useful to understand and predict how the forces modeled behave and interact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the simplest model of linear regression, look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivariate_analysis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;bivariate regression&lt;/a&gt;. For two observed variables &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;, you create a &lt;em&gt;regression equation&lt;/em&gt; that models the relationship between X and Y. The model, however, isn't actually representing &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;, but a new variable, let's call it &lt;code&gt;Y'&lt;/code&gt;. Then we arrive at something like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Y` = a + bX&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where the coefficients &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are chosen to minimize the discrepancy between &lt;code&gt;Y'&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;. If we draw out the variables as vectors in a vector space, we would have two vectors &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Y'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that, hopefully, lie very close to each other. But there is a vector &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; called the error such that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;e = Y - Y`&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The whole algorithm of linear regression is centered on optimizing &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; to minimize &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Sampling from the population&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, all models have some error term that we strive to minimize. And for a particular given set of points we may be able to optimize it such that we take the error &lt;strong&gt;perhaps&lt;/strong&gt; even to zero. But for any real world set of points where we have only been able to observe, and hence to model, a sample of the population of observances, the very next observance will potentially cause the error term to increase! This is true even of models that were not derived with &lt;strong&gt;machine-learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many, many useful models that break down for parts of the population of observances, but we still find them useful. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Newtonian Gravity&lt;/a&gt; which breaks down at certain points of the real-world, but gets most of it right and for which we regularly use for prediction and understanding, in part because it is much simpler to understand and manipulate than something more complex that deals with those other cases, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;GR&lt;/a&gt; which itself also fails to deal with some complex phenomena like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;quantum gravity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Over/Under fitting&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to minimizing the error &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, there are two other issues with models and performance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;overfitting and underfitting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In overfitting, a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfit has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Underfitting occurs when a statistical model or machine learning algorithm cannot capture the underlying trend of the data. Underfitting would occur, for example, when fitting a linear model to non-linear data. Such a model would have poor predictive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, finally, the premise: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;no machine learning algorithm can be perfect. If it was, it means it is overfitting and so it is not really perfect because it will not perform ok in real world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Misses the point that &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7822" LastEditorUserId="7822" LastEditDate="2017-06-12T18:09:08.150" LastActivityDate="2017-06-12T18:09:08.150" CommentCount="1" />

I'd also question the wisdom of training a reasonably sized network with a GA instead of a dedicated neural net training algorithm that's very likely to exhibit much better performance. However, assuming you really do need to do this, the basic approach is generally to do the following.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Decide on your range and precision. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to assume you use say L=16 bits to represent every weight. You can have some variables encoded at higher precision that others -- you're in charge of writing the encode/decode functions, so it's entirely up to you, but here, I'm assuming you don't. Your encoding will now be a vector of length 16n, where n is the number of weights in the network. You can use a string if you like, but it's probably a net loss of efficiency, as mostly what you'll be doing is converting those bits to integers so that you can do arithmetic necessary to decode the encoded weights, so I'd just make it a vector of 16n ints.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the range, you just need the minimum and maximum values you're going to allow. Again, for simplicity, I'm going to say the values range between -10 and 10, denoted as R_min=-10 and R_max=10.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your GA then just manipulates the 0s and 1s. To evaluate fitness, you have to decode each of those 16-bit strings into a double between -10 and 10. With 16 bits, you have 2^16=16536 possible values. The total range of output values is 10-(-10)=20. 20/16536=0.0012. Let 0000000000000000 be the smallest possible string, and map that onto the value -10. Now every increment to that binary string just adds 0.0012 to the output value. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Putting all this together, you have w_i = (R_max - R_min)/2^L + R_min. Do that for each block of 16 bits giving you each weight in the network. Run your network on your training data and use whatever accuracy metric as the fitness function for the GA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the GA itself now, you don't really have to do anything special. The GA can just see an arbitrary string of 16n bits. You can do crossover and mutation on just the apparently meaningless string of bits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your question was asking about going from a vector of weights to a vector of strings, which is the opposite conversion from that described above. Generally for a GA, you don't need a phenotype-&gt;genotype conversion. You just generate genotypes using genetic operators and use the genotype-&gt;phenotype conversion to evaluate candidate solutions. However, there are some reasons why you might want to go the other way. For instance, you might want to seed the population with a known set of weights, and so you'd need the ability to convert those weights to binary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically in that case, just invert that conversion function. The idea is to convert the floating point weight between R_min and R_max into the integer that's closest to the same distance into the range when mapped to 0 to 2^L-1. For example, if the weight is -10, then it's the smallest possible value. It maps onto the smallest possible value between 0 and 2^L-1, namely 0. Similarly, a weight of 0 maps onto (2^L-1)/2, because it's halfway between the min and max of both ranges. If you play around with it a bit, you should see that the expression here is given by floor((w_i - R_min)/(R_max - R_min) * 2^L). That gives me an integer in the range 0 to 2^L. From there, just do a standard binary encoding (or gray code, whatever) to get into a bit string you can manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3365" LastActivityDate="2017-06-16T16:22:35.843" CommentCount="0" />

Of course, we always need this kind of feedback in some way or another (otherwise, the machine would never learn, because it would have no incentive to change anything that it does), but the feedback can be classified into &quot;supervised&quot; if we have a clear way of telling when something was right/wrong, or &quot;unsupervised&quot; if we just roll out with the results and try to make it better each time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, an AI performing translation like in grammar induction in the other question will take as input both the phrase and the syntactic tree. After performing the prediction of what the syntactic tree for the phrase should be, it can be compared against the real syntactic tree given as input and based on the accuracy of the prediction, the weights (think of it as &quot;knobs&quot; that adjust the result) can be tweaked a little bit to give better predictions next time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This type of learning is considered supervised, not because of the existence of a supervisor, but rather because there is labeled data that we can use to test predictions and better them next time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unsupervised problems don't have this kind of labeled data, and just work with what they have. They cannot tell what's right and what's wrong in terms of predictions, they only have raw data and try to make sense out of it by extracting correlations or common properties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the case of a language, I will go on a limb here but I'll say that this is mostly likely a task for supervised algorithms. Unsupervised techniques could properly analyze language and determine that they actually have a particular structure, but this is also true for lots of other sources of data that are not language. An alien race, knowing nothing about humanity, could end up deducting that cars honking are some sort of language too, albeit much simpler than human-produced noises.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the natural flexibility that languages have make it extra complex, because they don't follow a correct structure completely, and to make it worse, they are constantly changing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As leitasat mentioned in their comment, if even human scientists (which we certainly deem intelligent) could not decipher ancient Egyptian on their own without any context, it's very unlikely that a machine would do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, notice that translator machines or inference machines don't actually derive meaning in a way that's meaningful. Without going much in much detail, you should think of them as &quot;correlation detection machines&quot; -- so a machine might notice a high enough correlation between how &quot;Hola&quot; is used in Spanish as to how &quot;Hi&quot; is used in English, and by giving you that information, we call it a translator. However, the internal learnt structure is actually just a probability distribution for an output given a set of inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not to say that any of this is not useful -- it definitely is -- but with something as separate as an alien race of super-human intelligence and without any way to derive meaning from just a bunch of sounds, it's very unlikely that a machine would prove useful in such correlations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And still, I cannot find any hard stop to your idea -- if these aliens have a language and they express the same concepts that human express, then there is correlation.

It also worked, but yet again, its fitness was determined by an existing function (sin (x)). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've recently been working on training it to play Tic Tac Toe. I decided that to determine its fitness, it would play against a &quot;dumb&quot; AI, placing O's in random locations on the grid, and gaining fitness based on whether or not it placed X's in a valid location (losing fitness if it placed an X on top of another X or an O), and gaining a lot of fitness if it won against the &quot;dumb&quot; AI. This would work, but when a network got really lucky and the &quot;dumb&quot; AI placed O's in impractical locations, the network would win and gain a lot of fitness, making it very difficult for another network to beat that fitness. Therefore, the learning process did not work and I was not able to generate a Tic Tac Toe network that actually worked well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not want the GA to learn based off an &quot;intelligent&quot; tic tac toe AI because the whole point of me training this GA is so that I do not have to make the AI in the first place. I want it to be able to learn rules on its own without me having to hard code an AI to be very good at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I got to thinking, and I thought it would be interesting if the fitness of a network could be determined based off how well it played against OTHER NETWORKS in its generation. This does seem similar to how humans learn to play games, as I learned to play chess by playing against other people hundreds of times, learning from my mistakes, and my friends also increased in their ability to play chess as well. If GA's were to do that, that would mean I don't have to program AI to play the game (in fact, I wouldn't have to program a &quot;dumb&quot; AI as well, I would only have to hard code the rules of the game, obviously). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My questions are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Has there been any research or results from GA's determining their fitness based off competing against each other? I did some searching but I have no idea what to look for in the first place (searching 'NEAT fight against each other' did not work well :-(  )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Does this method of training a GA seem practical? It seems practical to me, but are there any potential drawbacks to this? Are GA's meant to only calculate predetermined functions that exist, or do they have the potential to learn and do some decision making?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) If I were to do this, how would fitness be determined? Say, for the tic tac toe example, should fitness be determined based on whether or not a network places its X's or O's in viable locations, and add fitness if it wins and subtracts fitness if it loses? What about tying the game?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) Should networks of the same species compete against each other? If they did, then it would seem impractical to have species in the first place, as networks in the same species competing against each other would not allow a successful species to rise to the top, as it would be fighting against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5) Kind of out of topic, but with my original idea for the tic tac toe GA, would there be a better way to determine fitness?

NER tags consist of PER(person), LOC(location), ORG(organization) and MISC(miscellaneous) and O(other). with the help of a NER-tagger algorithm, you probably would have:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;My(O) favorite(O) book(O) is(O) harry(B-MISC) potter(I-MISC) and(I-MISC) the(I-MISC) prisoner(I-MISC) of(I-MISC) azkaban(I-MISC).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;now you can tokenize your text with identifying different NER tags, and join &quot;B-&quot; and &quot;I-&quot; prefixes with the same NER tag. e.g. you have &quot;harry potter and ...&quot; as a single token, which is a MISC and starts from harry (since harry is B-MISC) and ends to azkaban (since azkaban has the last consecutive I-MISC tag). Now you can let your POS tagger act the &quot;harry potter ...&quot; as a single token, and it must tag it with &quot;NN&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another solution for this problem is called &quot;chunking&quot;. It works based on a set of rules and detect Noun Phrases (NPs). Here, you define a rule and create the regexp statement for it. e.g. you define all consecutive &lt;code&gt;NN&lt;/code&gt;s as a single NP (harry potter): &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;NN&amp;gt;+&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;DT&lt;/code&gt; followed by a string of &lt;code&gt;NN&lt;/code&gt;s (the brown fox): &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;DT&amp;gt;?&amp;lt;NN&amp;gt;+&lt;/code&gt;.

But they're just guessing, and nobody knows if they type of singularity proposed is even possible.  We still don't understand how the human brain works, or if strong Artificial General Intelligence is even possible.  &lt;em&gt;(I personally think it definitely is, but am skeptical of the optimistic predictions in terms of when.

For that reason, I'd think any simulation would only approximate reality, and not be 100% accurate predictively. My guess is you'd have to run a very high number of such simulations, then statistically determine which outcome would be most likely based on a set of outcomes, but the more you narrowed that to a single result, the lower the accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about Conway's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Undecidability&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; in relation to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Laplace's Demon&lt;/a&gt; lately. Perhaps Game of Life would provide some insight. I think part of the problem there is that there is still a hard limit to the speed of information in the system (which can be analogous to the hard limit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt; in the &quot;real&quot; world.)  Game of Life is a deterministic with a single node for each ply of the (predictive) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_tree&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;game tree&lt;/a&gt;. Predicting the outcome of a novel, non-trivial starting configuration is indistinguishable from running the simulation.  But the only entity that has perfect information in regards to the entire system is the system itself. It's possible that an intelligent construct within Game of Life could model outcomes of local phenomena, but perfect information on the entire system is an impossibility, and as with quantum phenomena, trading of information actually affects the system. (See glider guns.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;@k.c. posted a very useful link on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_of_computation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Limits of Computation&lt;/a&gt;, which is probably a much less convoluted approach to the question;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the problem you propose is deeper because we still don't even know if there is true randomness is nature (quantum phenomenon) or if indeterminacy, and the probabilities that arise out of it, are merely functions of the limits of observations, which is well defined in the mathematics, but also has a philosophical component.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quantum phenomena don't directly affect the macro world, but can bleed into it in areas such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/339984/152803&quot;&gt;formation of crystalline structures&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So until we can solve the randomness question, and find some way around the observational problems at the quantum level, I don't think we could model the type of systems you're asking about with perfect accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further Reading:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I strongly advise you take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quantum_Thief&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Quantum Thief&lt;/a&gt; trilogy by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannu_Rajaniemi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Hannu Rajaneimi&lt;/a&gt;.  I always recommend these books for interesting questions such as this, not simply because Rananeimi deeply explores the type of post-Singularity world you're thinking about, but because he's a mathematical physicist, and his grasp of the mathematics involved, including quantum theory, is far superior to mine and almost certainly other authors of speculative fiction, whether literary or under the moniker of &quot;futurists&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His take is that even with all of the computing power you envision, at a level of technology where matter and information are interchangeable, perfectly accurate prediction of the future is not possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it is this next part you may find interesting:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rajaneimi inverts your concept of the &quot;Time Leap&quot; by instead talking about the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Time&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Deep Time refers to what a consciousness can experience at peak processor speeds.

Although it seems overkill to use neural networks, I find them to perform better than my initial experiments with other approaches, because I can very precisely tune their objective function and regularization, along with a nice possibility for multinomial regression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A severe problem in the task at hand&lt;/strong&gt; is that the data in the tables may be adjusted over time. So the database might say that a given feature was last changed at 2016-01-01 11:45, but in reality, a slight change was made a 2016-01-15 07:38. In practice, this means that the training data is unrealistically precise, and that I may instead want to consider it a ballpark estimate.&#xA;For example, a value of 153.18 may instead be considered a value of ~140-165.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To alleviate the problem, I have theorized a &quot;jitter&quot; neuron&lt;/strong&gt; that - during training time, at each iteration - &quot;jitters&quot; the input by subtracting or adding a random value from the feature. The random value to add or subtract is a ratio of the standard deviation of the feature, and the ratio is itself random.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The layer is placed right after the input neurons and has as many neurons as there are input features. In my example, the layer is therefore 1500 neurons wide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example&lt;/strong&gt;, consider an input feature that - across all training samples - has a standard deviation of +- 100.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At training time, a data sample is loaded with the feature value of 1122 (for the sake of example, lets ignore input standardization), and the jitter neuron will incur a randomized change in its value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We define a &quot;jitter&quot; ratio of 0.1, meaning that the ratio to &quot;jitter&quot; the feature with is drawn from a standard distribution with a standard deviation of 0.1 and a mean of 0. In the example, a random roll of the dice lands us in +1.5 standard deviations, outputting a jitter ratio of 0.15.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that the training set has a standard deviation of 100, we add to the input feature (that has a value of 1122) a final jitter of +15, resulting in an input feature value of 1137.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same operation goes for all input features. Pragmatically, I do this in keras by generating a jitter-ratio-matrix with mean=0 and std=0.1. The std-value can be an arbitrary amount, but we must not jitter the input data too much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The intuitive justification&lt;/strong&gt; is that it is representative of my real world scenario. Without going into too many details, the input features are typically things such as weather, whose forecasts are naturally unstable, and any changes to the database values backwards in time is likely to be a &quot;typical&quot;, small adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a more theoretical level&lt;/strong&gt;, the justification is that it prevents overfitting to specific input features in some samples, as the next iteration across the same data sample will output significantly different output values after the forward pass through the network, as a slight change in the input feature may have a profound impact on the output after the feature has undergone compounding, non-linear activations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I perceive the jitter-neuron to be a form of data-augmentation, like it is done for especialle image classification; instead of the architect generating n augmented samples according to some heuristic (for example, in images, it is normal to crop and rotate the same image in several different ways to enlarge the training set), the jitter neuron generates a theorhetically infinite amount of augmentations at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I keep imagining the parameter hyperspace for the neuron weights in the first layer; instead of having many potential pits (i.e. areas of overfitting), the jitter smooths out these pits, as the jittered input data now generates a different loss value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early experiments&lt;/strong&gt; do not provide very good results, but not bad either. They just, sort of... Stay the same...

More recently, the protein folding game &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foldit#Accomplishments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Foldit&lt;/a&gt; produced real results in an applied field. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The answer I usually give is that games such as Chess and Go provide complexity akin to nature using extremely simple parameters.  (In essence, combinatorial games and puzzles, like Sudoku, are complexity engines.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But games, unlike puzzles, which are solo endeavors, require a type of strategic decision-making that is quite useful. (@Ugnes answer lists many of them.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Combinatorial games in particular provide a useful benchmark for the capability of algorithms to manage intractable problems.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; factor.  Algorithmic language translation has gotten extremely good in recent years, but you never hear the press making a big deal about it.  Compare to DeepBlue vs. Kasparov, or AlphaGo vs. Sedol. (This stack exploded with ML questions after the AlphaGo result.)  This is similar to the US moon landings, which was great, if not strictly necessary, engineering feat that inspired generations of budding scientists. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Postscript: It's notable that until recently, the term &quot;strong&quot; was reserved for Artificial General Intelligence, which is still highly theoretical.  After AlphaGo, I'm starting to see scholars use the term &quot;Strong Narrow AI.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of strong in relation to Artificial General Intelligence is purely philosophical. By contrast, the way the term is used in Combinatorial Game Theory (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Solved Game&lt;/a&gt;) is purely practical and involves mathematical proofs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chess remains unsolved, and therefore it is still useful for study.  [See GiraffeChess following.]  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fields of Game Theory and Combinatorial Game Theory include names like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Von Neumann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Conway&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Demaine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Demain&lt;/a&gt; at MIT.   And if you want to include combinatorial puzzles like Sudoku, we can stretch this back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeco-Latin_square&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Euler&lt;/a&gt;.

This is significant and is the most damning of all arguments against the idea of humans creating true existential consciousness in silicon creatures as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The greatest philosophical debate on consciousness has focused the distinction between Dualism and Physicalism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⦁ &lt;strong&gt;Physicalism&lt;/strong&gt; holds that consciousness is entirely physical. (&lt;strong&gt;Significant arguments view it as false&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⦁ &lt;strong&gt;Dualism&lt;/strong&gt; is the theory that consciousness somehow falls outside the domain of the physical. (these are the &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt; problems)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why would one be motivated to hold one of the above &lt;strong&gt;Dualist&lt;/strong&gt; views? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⦁ Physicalists have &lt;strong&gt;trouble&lt;/strong&gt; explaining several aspects of consciousness in a way that is consistent with our &quot;&lt;strong&gt;observations&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; of how physical properties interact.

Most obviously, it utilizes a larger state which is discretized (addressable) into chunks; this allows it to make the forget gate of the LSTM more binary. By this I mean that the state is not necessarily eroded by some fraction at every time step, whereas in the LSTM (with the sigmoid activation function) it necessarily is. This might reduce the problem of catastrophic forgetting that you mentioned and thus scale better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The DNC is also novel in the links that it uses between memory. However, this might be a more marginal improvement on the LSTM than it seems if we re-imagine the LSTM with complete neural networks for each gate instead of just a single layer with an activation function (call this a super-LSTM); in this case, we can actually learn any relationship between two slots in memory with a sufficiently powerful network. While I don't know the specifics of the links that DeepMind is suggesting, they imply in the article that they are learning everything just by backpropagating gradients like a regular neural network. Therefore whatever relationship they are encoding in their links should theoretically be learnable by a neural network, and so a sufficiently powerful 'super-LSTM' should be able to capture it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With all that being said&lt;/strong&gt;, it is often the case in deep learning that two models with the same theoretical capability for expressiveness perform vastly different in practice. For example, consider that a recurrent network can be represented as a huge feed-forward network if we just unroll it. Similarly, the convolutional network isn't better than a vanilla neural network because it has some extra capacity for expressiveness; in fact, it is the constraints imposed on its weights that makes it &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; effective. Thus comparing the expressiveness of two models isn't necessarily a fair comparison of their performance in practice, nor an accurate projection of how well they will scale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One question I have about the DNC is what happens when it runs out of memory. When a classical computer runs out of memory and another block of memory is requested, programs start crashing (at best). I'm curious to see how DeepMind plans to address this. I assume it will rely on some intelligent cannibalization of memory currently in use. In some sense computers currently do this when an OS requests that applications free up non-critical memory if memory pressure reaches a certain threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8366" LastActivityDate="2017-07-10T16:42:20.013" CommentCount="1" />

Since it is mentioned, the issues in defining it should also be addressed in a comprehensive answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One could say that a program cp.c, when compiled and then executed in such a way as to copy its own source code, has exhibited the minimal criteria for self-awareness.  What is it to know thyself?  To examine, in a thought experiment, the other extreme, we could consider an extremely self-aware Buddhist.  If the heart rate of such a person increased when told that she or he has phase four cancer, has this person failed at reliable self-awareness in that a model of self failed to sustain under the common and inevitable circumstance of facing physical mortality?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplifying Multidimensional Quantities to a Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the possibility that self-awareness, like intelligence, is not on a singly dimensional line.  There may be a million dimensions to intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It may be someday found that IQ is a measure of how undisturbed by distractions a mind is, not a measure of its capacity to problem solve.  There are simple thought experiments that illustrate that there MUST be at least two dimensions to intelligence and likely many more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Winning in a game of tic-tac-toe may be an extremely difficult problem when a loaded gun is placed on the thinkers temple, yet the invention of physics might have been a simple problem for Isaac Newton once an apple hit the ground as he was thinking about how Kepler's ellipses might relate to a cannonball.  (Newton realized that a powerful enough explosion could propel the cannonball into orbit, thereby opening a door into the unification of astronomy and mechanics.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unreliable General Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The typical human brain includes a cerebral cortex that represents over 80% of brain mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons.  It is not a digital machine, except perhaps at the quantum level.  Nonetheless it is does not exhibit reliable general intelligence, defining reliability in this context as the ability to arrive at a functional solution for arbitrarily selected (however well defined) problems in a generalized domain most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Carl Jung noted that the human intelligence in modern times has dismissed many of the irrational constructs of the ancient mind but is prone to, &quot;Lack of insight,&quot; as a consequence.  In his Man and His Symbols he claims that such dismissal leads to neurosis, which can, in AI terms, be characterized as an inability to bring the massive power of the cerebral cortex to bear on the most grave of problems and their obvious solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A gross example is the geopolitical philosophy that the existence of two or more countries with a nuclear first strike capability against each other will deter war between them.  Any high school student that have mastered the concepts of probability and limits can be shown that the probability of this geopolitical philosophy remaining effective through the age of thermonuclear build up and proliferation approaches zero as time approaches infinity.  Yet a billion people live under threats of annihilation without complaint or consideration in direct rational opposition to this mathematical fact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyone familiar with gambling, drug, or other forms of addiction know that the simple accessibility of the object of addiction repeatedly leads to destructive behavior in these addicts that have an otherwise functional mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure of Intelligence Dependent Upon Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it is indeed possible for a human mind or consortium of human minds to develop a machine of greater reliable and general intelligence than itself, a currently unproven hypothesis, if employed in stock trading for a millionaire attempting to achieve billionaire status, will the machine decide to deny the millionaire her or his objective to the betterment of humanity, as in Isaac Asimov's Zeroth Law of Robotics?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If so, it could not be considered to have functioned per the instructions of its owner. Yet one could argue that if the high speed trading made the economy more vulnerable to crashes or unevenly distributed wealth to the degree that it hindered human progress it would have to lack intelligence to continue the trading per system specification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, whether a machine is generally intelligent is dependent upon where it is deployed and what its owner is asked to do.  It would be equally reasonable to argue (although there may be counter arguments) that for a machine to have general intelligence it must be left to autonomous objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Terminator television and movie series illustrates one of those potential autonomous objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barring All the Above&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if a machine could be devised that could simulate general problem solving capacities of the best of humans without the formation of neuroses, addiction, poly-homicidal tendencies, or mental illnesses of other types, the formation of insights from data is not a simple task.  It could take a billion networked processor and bit storage devices and a million years of teams of a million people to program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It may take this amount of time and these time and personnel resources to convert insights to instructions too.   Estimates vary greatly in order of magnitude.  Without data on hardware and software designs of this magnitude as a part of human history, estimations are inescapably conjecture based on metrics related to the human brain.

It quickly became orthodox because of an array of emerging trends in thought about automation among scientists and mathematicians in times immediately following western industrialization.  This thinking was the natural extension of the mechanization of the printing, textile, agriculture, and transportation industries and of war.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the mid-twentieth century, some of these trends combined to conceptualize the digital computer.  Others became orthodoxy within the community of people investigating aspects of intelligence via digital systems.  The technical backdrop included theoretical work and electro-mechanical work, some of which has since achieved a degree of public fame.  But it was generally either secret or too abstract (and therefore obscure) to be considered items of national security interest at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cybernetics theory, largely developed by Norbert Wiener (1894 – 1964)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The work done on automating arithmetic (extending George Boole's theory and Blaise Pascal's calculator, with primary funding originating from the U.S. military in an interest in guiding anti-aircraft weaponry by calculating probable trajectories of enemy of aircraft and determining spherical coordinates to create a probable interesting ballistic trajectory&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Often dismissed work of Alonso Church (1903 – 1995) on lambda calculus which led to the idea of functional programming, a key aspect to the emergence of LISP in Cambridge, which McCarthy leveraged for early AI experimentation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The birth of information theory, primarily through the work of Claude Shannon (1916 – 2001), funded through Bell Labs in the interest of automating communications switching&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The early cryptanalysis work of Church's doctoral student, Alan Turing, funded entirely by Allied Forces with the R&amp;amp;D goal of defeating the Enigma cryptography device so that Nazi forces could be stopped prior to the complete annihilation of London and other Allied targets&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The work on John von Neumann (1903 – 1957) toward centralizing the implementation of arbitrary Boolean logic together with integer arithmetic into a single unit (currently called a CPU) and storing the program that controlled the implementation in electronic flip-flops along with the data to be processed and the results (the same general architecture imployed by almost all contemporary computing devices today)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these were concepts surrounding the vision of automata, the simulation of functional aspects of mammalian neurology.  (A monkey or elephant can successfully plan and execute the swatting of a fly, but a fly is incapable of planning and executing an attack on a monkey or elephant.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Experimentation into intelligence and its simulation via symbolic manipulation using a new programming language, LISP, was a primary focus of John McCarthy and his role in the creation of the MIT AI Laboratory.  But whatever orthodoxy may have existed with rule based (production systems), neural nets, and genetic algorithms has largely diversified into a cloud of ideas that make the term orthodoxy somewhat nebulous.  A few examples follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Richard Stallman resigned from the MIT AI Lab and began a philosophical shift away from many of the economic philosophies that dominated that time period.  The result was GNU software and LINUX, followed by open hardware and creative commons, concepts largely opposed to the philosophic orientation of those that funded AI hotbeds.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many proprietary (and therefore company confidential) systems use Bayesian methods or adaptive components that stem more from Norbert Wiener's work than anything that was considered mainstream AI research in the 1970s.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Birth of Game Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key event that answers the question most directly in this parade of historical events is some other work of von Neumann's.  His book Game Theory, coauthored with Oskar Morgenstern, is perhaps the strongest factor among the historical conditions that led to the persistence of Go and Chess as test scenarios for problem solving software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although there were many earlier works on how to win in Chess or Go, never before was there a mathematical treatment and a presentation as compelling as that in Game Theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The privileged members of the scientific community were well aware of von Neumann's success with raising the temperature and pressure of fissile material to critical mass and his work in deriving classic thermodynamics from quantum theory.  The foundation of mathematics he presented in Game Theory was quickly accepted (by some of the same people that funded research at MIT) as a potential predictive tool for economics.  Predicting economics was the first step in controlling it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theory Meets Geopolitical Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The dominant philosophy that drove western policy during that period was Manifest Destiny, essentially the fatalist view of a New World Order, the head of which would be in the seats of U.S. power.  Declassified documents indicate that it is highly likely that leaders of that time saw economic domination achieved through the application of game theory as considerably less risky and expensive than military conquest followed by the maintenance of bases of operations (high tech garrisons) near every populated area overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The highly publicized challenges to develop Chess and Go automatons are simply dragnets that corporations and governments use as a first cut in the acquisition of personnel assets.  The game results are like resumes.  A winning game playing program is a piece of evidence of the existence of programming skill that would likely also succeed in the development of more important games that move billions of dollars or win wars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those who can write winning Chess or Go code are considered high value assets.  Funding game playing research has been seen as a way of identifying those assets.  Even in the absence of immediate return on investment, the identification of these assets, because they can be tucked away in think tanks to plot out the domination of the world, have become a primary consideration when research funds are allocated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow and Fast Paths to Return on Investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to this geopolitical thinking, seeking institutional prestige on the back of some crafty programmer or team is another factor.  In this scenario, any progress in simulating intelligence that has a potential of geometric improvements in some important industry or military application was sought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, programs like Maxima (a forerunner of mathematical problem solving applications such as Mathematica) were funded with the hope of developing mathematics using symbolic computing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This path to success conceptually rested on determinism as an overarching natural philosophy.  In fact, it was the epitome of determinism.  It was proposed that, if a computer could not only do arithmetic but develop mathematical theorems of super-human complexity, models of human endeavors could be reduced to equations and solved.  The predictability for a wide variety of important economic, military, and political phenomena could then be used in decision making, permitting significant gain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To the surprise of many, the success of Maxima and other mathematics programs was very limited in its positive impact on the ability to reliably predict economic and geopolitical events.  The emergence of Chaos Theory explained why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beating a human master with a program turned out to be within the reach of twentieth century R&amp;amp;D.  Use of software to experiment on various computer science approaches to winning a game was achievable and therefore more attractive for institutions as a way of gaining prestige, much like a winning basketball team.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let's Not Forget Discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes appearances are in direct opposition to actuality.  The various above mentioned applications of thinking machines nave not been forgotten, and the expense in time and money required to simulate aspects of mammalian abilities will not loose funding to board game automaton development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technology is largely occupied with solving communications, military, geopolitical, economic, and financial problems that far exceed the complexity of games like Chess and Go.   Game theory includes elements of random moves made by non-players as far back as its inception.  Therefore, the obsession with Chess and Go is merely a signature of the actual focus of funding and activity in the many fields of simulating intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Software that can play a mean game of Chess or Go is deployed to neither NSA global modelling computers nor Google's indexing machinery.  The big dollars are spent to develop what IS deployed into such places.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will never see details on or even an overview of that R&amp;amp;D described online, except in the case of people who, for some personally compelling reason, violate their company confidential agreements or commit treason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4302" LastEditorUserId="4302" LastEditDate="2017-07-11T06:09:28.180" LastActivityDate="2017-07-11T06:09:28.180" CommentCount="1" />

All are good questions and fairly easy to answer, assuming that the word 'replicate' can be replaced with 'model' or 'simulate'.

Applying this visualization to represent probable relationships between legal entities from matrices of historical market data is quite possible and may have many uses for financial analysis.  Such a graph can be visualized using GraphViz, Mathematica, Matlab, or various libraries available for use from programming environments of Python, C++, Java, LISP, JavaScript or other languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vertices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of vertices representing legal entities registered as tax entities, as in many of the web services that display graphs from public records and purchased aggregated corporate data, the vertices in the graph presumably envisioned by the questioner would represent tradable securities.  The attributes of such vertices might be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Exchange&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unique exchange ID (symbol)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Name&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An array of vectors of historical trade metrics (with each vector containing a UTC time stamp)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edges represent the probable strength of financial connectedness between any two vertices representing two tradable securities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the nature of relationships and the associated details between the corporations offering tradable securities and the mindsets of all the trading agents are obscured, relationships must be inferred naively (without factual knowledge of causality), perhaps using the probability relations of Rev. Thomas Bayes (1701 – 1761) or other more sophisticated methods (some of which cannot, for legal reasons, be detailed here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Relational models must be created (likely more than one) to capitalize on identifiable features in the trading metrics of one of two selected vertices and match that feature with the same or another feature in the other of the two vertices.  The correlation must be statistical and designed in such a way as to be resistant to effects outside the relationship between the two legal entities associated with the two tradable securities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naive Bayesian classification, other statistical approaches, FFTs, or neural nets may apply to assist with achieving a functional correlation value.  Windowing the data in a loop will be necessary to implement sensitivity to single events sparsely spaced in the time domain of the historical data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To attempt to guess causality, you will need to apply different temporal shifts to see if the feature of one preceded the feature of the other and by how much.  (If event A in security B preceded event C in security D, and this pattern repeats over a range of months or years, then there is a probability greater than zero that event C was caused by event A.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The science (and perhaps the art) of creating a set of potential mathematical models of how various corporate and trading relationships may have impacted historical trade metrics between any two securities is the first hurdle in this proposed best approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using various known methods, a probability distribution of the single dimensional or multi-dimensional strength of the relationship, for each of the proposed models, can be calculated from the historical data of the two entities between which one of the many inter-vertex analyses is occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Statistics of these distributions would then be the attributes of the edge shown between two vertices.  For more intuitive usability, the following attributes would need to be available via point and click drill down for each edge and each model tried between the two tradable securities connected by the edge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Median relationship strength&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mean relationship strength&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Standard deviation of relationship &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Direction of causality&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Median delay in causality&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measures to Make Computation Time Practical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish the above each vertex would ideally be compared with each other vertex, for each model, iterating through temporal parameters of the model to determine relationships involving time delays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there were a hundred tradables to consider, ten probabilistic relationship models, a thousand temporal permutations that must be tried to converge on a good fit between each model and the historical data, a hundred iterations to converge for each temporal window, a window of a thousand temporal observations, ten thousand windows to cover the entire range of historical data, and a thousand cycles for each test of fit, the primary computations would be 100 x 99 x 10 x 1000 x 100 x 1000 x 10,000 x 1000 = 99 x 10^18 CPU cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(The number 99 comes from the fact that, without some permutation elimination scheme, the histories of each of 100 vertices must be compared with those of the other 99.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several methods may be applied together to reduce this set of expanded permutations to permit batch process completion after the close of the market in NY or Hong Kong and before the time zone dependent dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Filtering and then decimating (removing redundancy) the historical data&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Truncating the historical data to analyze only the recent (and therefore the most relevant) historical data&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Widening the error margin to only what is displayed (such as two significant figures)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Optimizations of algorithms, the mathematics behind them, the machine instruction representation of computations, or the mapping of values to data types&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Distributing analysis processes to take advantage of parallel computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Limiting the list of tradable securities using a narrowing set of inclusion criteria&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Early elimination of possible edges between unlikely relational candidates using heuristics, model simplifications, neural nets, or fuzzy logic&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once models are generated and functional and some of the visualized constructs can be verified, then the relational models can be used to predict probable events before they occur.  This may seem like science fiction to some, but we predict physical, social, and economic events all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the profitability in relation to markets, if such predictive tools were to be distributed to eleven other traders, the ability to use the tool to generate profit would almost immediately deteriorate to one twelfth in monetary value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is probably the state of the market today.  Only those with automated tools are probable winners, funneling money from those without tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AI Research Perspective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the above does not seem like AI the way it is described, often what is conceived as an intelligent agent and appears intelligent in behavior after deployed, refined, and tuned, appears like straight software engineering when one gets into the details of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the method for interfacing with the models used to match features in the history of two tradables is generalized so that arbitrary models can be added or modified at will without damaging the effectiveness of job execution, one can build some sort of analogy of a genetic algorithm to search for models that exhibit higher correlations and therefore progressively enhance predictive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta Modelling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point in development, model development is still largely up to the researcher.  However, once a model interface, perhaps employing the bridge and facade design patterns, is developed, it is possible to generalize the concept of historical feature correlation between two tradables as models with a set of mutation operations and develop concurrent processes that employ an automated experimental test fixture to develop new models without programmer intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the details of such meta-modelling cannot, for legal reasons, be detailed here, the meta-model design options naturally become apparent after some experience is gained after implementing and deploying the above approach in a real scenario with actual tradable historical data. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Off the Shelf Code, Libraries, and Frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there is appreciable monetary value to this type of development, therefore it is unlikely that anyone will post (or even sell) code specific to this domain.  However using super-computing platforms, basic analysis algorithms such as FFT functions, and statistics packages with correlation coefficient routines, naive Bayesian capabilities, and convergence detection support will certainly assist in reducing the development effort required to implement and test this approach or others like it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4302" LastEditorUserId="4302" LastEditDate="2017-07-15T06:10:36.853" LastActivityDate="2017-07-15T06:10:36.853" CommentCount="2" />

One example is the set of complex recognition functions underneath the typical listening skill set of a counselling professional.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;affective computing&lt;/em&gt; was mentioned in the question.  A counselor may note the affect of the counselled, reading tone of voice, facial expression sequences, and body language.  From this, a clearer picture of the internal emotional state of the counselled can be understood.  These recognition and analysis abilities can determine the subject's internal emotional state more accurately and comprehensively than a masterful analysis of a functional MRI or the detection of neuro-chemical metabolites in blood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no theoretical principle that limits computers from mastering the front end of a counselor's skill set, the recognition of emotion to produce a coded sequence of affects.  The degree to which software can interpret the sequence of affects (in combination with concurrent natural language expressions) and determine the emotional condition (and potential market-oriented decision patterns) of the human is yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are other emotional capabilities beyond the skills of emotional recognition and interpretation.  Compassion is largely the logical integration of ethics in the absence of self-centered motive with the results of emotional recognition and interpretation.  The addition of emotional imitation yields empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The development of such capabilities in automata is more important than the shallow and therefore myopic motives of e-Commerce.

(Such is discussed further below.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Functions of recognition, interpretation, the application of rules or meta-rules in the ethical domain to these interpretations, and imitation may well be within the capabilities of digital systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Isaac Asimov introduced the possibility of telepathy to the feature set of both the human mind and automata.  It may seem like telepathy is confined to the domain of fiction, however an emoticon can be the tele-form of a component of affect, such as a smile.  In this way, consensual technology assisted telepathy has actually become commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the erosion of privacy in a culture with increasing interaction with digital systems by an increasing segment of the public, less consensual telepathic techniques may be developed and mastered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deeper Aspects of the Question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The doubt lies in the existence of a soul or some other autonomous and non-deterministic aspect of the human person.  The existence of these things and whether the simulation of them can be accomplished with a Turing machine and practically deployed to the Von Neumann architecture or a collection of them have neither been proven or dis-proven formally.  If autonomous and non-deterministic elements exist in people, then, even if they can be simulated, we cannot infur they can be realized as independently autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Challenging the implications of the MIT coined term &lt;em&gt;Meat Machine&lt;/em&gt;, the notion that humans are capable of intention by fiat is not disproven, yet a pure Turing machine clearly cannot intend in that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is important in the context of the question in that a computer may only be able to simulate frustration when an intention is thwarted by the conditions of life.  Actual frustration may not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Publicly Experienced Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One interesting entry point of computer science into the domain of human emotions is the story based memory and reasoning model purported by Roger Schank of Yale U in the 1990s.  Although the machinery used by Amazon underneath the hold of its ever improving ability to recommend movies in a buyer specific way is Company Confidential to Amazon, one must wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can e-Commerce develop user profiling regarding books and movies to comprehend the story plot or the arc of protagonist's emotional development? Can it do so sufficiently to match user viewing and purchase with other products?  Is that what Amazon is beginning to do?  Short of an unethical Amazon employee, we can only guess.  Certainly, what is transpiring in leading edge e-Commerce has moved beyond word or phrase matching or tracking interest in particular authors, screenwriters, directors, producers, and stars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If Roger Schank's story based memory and reasoning has penetrated into e-Commerse, emotional analysis of individuals of within public is well underway, since story plot and protagonist developmental arcs are bound in climaxes and setting up climaxes, all related to emotional states.  If not, emotional analysis of groups within the public has been underway since public relations functions entered into the roles of enterprise IT systems.  (I know for a fact that such occurred decades ago.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if the likes of Facebook, Google, and Amazon are attempting to approximate in various ways the emotional states of individuals in real time, the matching of movie plots of protagonist arcs and such pattern matching and naive categorization is far from what a good counselor or a self-actualized friend or family member might do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Computer systems to which the public is exposed do not yet appear to accurately developing comprehension of the buyer's emotion.  That is one area where even the most progressive interfaces are still shy.  Furthermore, the computer interface itself is still as dry as it was in the late 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Short of breaches of confidentiality, what capabilities to recognize, compare, analyze, or simulate emotions may exist in proprietary labs is solely a mater of conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm Interfaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Returning to the question of the general coldness of cybernetic interfaces in a technological society, there is much for the computer science community to learn.  For one thing, the soft skills of actual technical people often leaves much to be desired, so a cultural shift from cold development teams to culturally progressive and warm teams might be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, one who has engaged with various PaaS (personality as a service) devices such as Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Cortana, and Microsoft's Office Assistant, Clippy, might find the paperclip personality of Clippy to be the warmer from among the list.  Perhaps the Clippy didn't see a higher level of acceptance because of the disparity between the coldness of a grid of cells in a spreadsheet and the attempted warmth of the animated character was too much, and the little guy tends to get in the way of some portion of the interface, which can be annoying.  (Integration of concepts was poor.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the animated style of Clippy is intended to create a mental association with cartoon characters, which is brilliant.  Cartoon character design and storytelling through comic and cartoon media is a creative area of technology that had mastered computer generated warmth long before intelligent assistants began to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One can't help thinking, upon general survey of intelligent assistant history, that the more the system tries to be human, the less human it seems.  Human response to emotional content in a cybernetic interface is like that of color matching or synthesized musical instruments.  If one is attempting to synthesize, the synthesis has to be good.  If it can't be fully convincing, then there is more authenticity in inventing something that is not pretending to be something real.  A caricature of real life objects (like Sponge Bob or Road Runner) avoids exposing an unacceptable margin of error in the imitation of real life. &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our sensitivity in this area is so acute that if a real person, working in a customer service department, acts too mechanically such that we have even the slightest doubt as to whether we are talking to a human being, the impression is negative and we want to hang up and look for the function we wish to initiate on the company's web site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the trend for people to become more like cogs in a machine or whether usage patterns will drive companies to design their user interfaces and the mechanisms behind them to exude something like hospitality or congeniality.  Although Jaques Ellul seems to be correct in his proposition that technology has long since been driving humanity rather than the other way around, the DNA nature of the human mind will perhaps force humanity to remain remarkably human.  Thus the evolution of cybernetic interface professionals may continue to seek the meaning of and simulation of warmth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problematic, controvertible, and somewhat bizarre pursuit of Turing Testing will probably endure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns About Emotional Modelling Uses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether an emotional recognition, modelling, analysis, and comparison suite, obviously a powerful tool-set, is used for the betterment of humanity or its detriment is a question like that of any other powerful tool-set.  Mass psychology, nuclear science, statistics, and genetics have in common the potential for great good or great evil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the context of this question, broadcast or more targeted information dissemination can be characterized as propaganda, which may not necessarily be perilous.  Propaganda was used for women's suffrage and along the path of U.S. independence from Europe.  Elements of broadcast and targeted control have created much geopolitical trouble, a topic outside of the scope of this social network, but pertinent and somewhat obvious, such that further mention is unnecessary anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Individual profiling can be of great good too.  Such can be like a combination of the old library subject indexed Dewey Decimal cards in combination with a knowledgeable librarian when looking for information or items of entertainment or personal expression for borrowing, rental, or purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, profiling in combination with statistics can lead to the ability to obtain covert control over a mass of people, not just for the profit maximization of a company.  An appropriately self-deluded megalomaniac or a collection of them in some kind of secret society could use emotional modelling and comprehensive user profiling for a large sample of national or global population for the injection of emotionally powered systems of belief.  Such a person or group could theoretically succeed in covert and systematic sublimation of liberty to a kind of virtual authoritarian dictatorship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How technology is used is always a concern.  Transparency and accountability are required features of a society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as in the other areas of science and technology mentioned above, it is up to we who are skilled enough to realize these systems to be intelligent and active elements within our society's accountability mechanisms.  Whether a corporation or governmental department is leading humanity into perdition is an item that can be judged during a job hunt and during the initial work period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the strongest critique of the Turing's Imitation Game philosophy.  Cartoons, comics, and sci-fi creatures demonstrate that people don't seem to care if intelligent beings can be distinguished from humans, and there is no proof that human intelligence is the only or the best example of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along these same lines, heroes are representations of intelligent behavior that epitomize some aspect of humanity that actually doesn't naturally occur in pure form as they do with these protagonists.  Yet actors are branded and marketed as stars because of this idyllic expression of character.  It may be that humans don't really like human intelligence and constantly try to transcend it through fiction, but results in only some public awareness that is never more than an anthropological fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even AI is not an imitation game.  It is a transcendence game.  For this reason, the Turing Test is of limited value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4302" LastEditorUserId="4302" LastEditDate="2017-07-18T07:54:28.923" LastActivityDate="2017-07-18T07:54:28.923" CommentCount="0" />

Although these concepts are not AI specific, they certainly apply to such development in the way the question suggests.  Leading AI R&amp;amp;D is occurring in  a relatively small number of corporate, governmental, and university research labs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A simple search for &lt;em&gt;Oligopoly vs Monopoly&lt;/em&gt; will cover the differences between these two scenarios sufficiently for all sectors of products and services, and those concepts and observations apply to a large degree in the AI case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those who have not studied economics or political science might incorrectly conclude that oligopoly is necessarily related to capitalistic competition and monopoly is related to communism. However, R&amp;amp;D monopolies frequently exist within capitalistic economies and oligopolies frequently exist in a planned economies, such as communist states.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengths of Each&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research oligopoly strengths:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lead to diversity of approaches and target products and services&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lower the probability of ethical, environmental, or social technology abuses because multiple independent teams, even with corporate confidentiality are in place, exert the force of at least a modicum of accountability&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research monopoly strengths:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Efficient in terms of return on research investment for two reasons (1) the division of a fixed amount of available research funding between several labs can increase the R&amp;amp;D required to produce usable results, and (2) unfruitful approaches are more quickly abandoned when their workers can be shifted to other teams within the same organization&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attract all those who have the most talent and experience in the fields needed by the specific R&amp;amp;D into one place to potentially collaborate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting Transitions Between Monopolistic and 'Oligopolistic' Forms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The leading edge of any R&amp;amp;D tends to begin as a monopoly or a 'biopoly'.  Three or more units beginning the same research at the same time or being funded by government at the same time (as in planned economies) is unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over time, employees tend to leave and start their own organizations, more so in capitalistic societies, but also in planned economies, where government may hear cases to branch off and grant permission or the scientist may, in one way or another, seek relocation to a free economy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can see these trends throughout technological history, back to early forms of writing, crop irrigation and plowing, chariot development, and ship building.  Modern examples include the application of the Westinghouse-Tesla model of electrical energy distribution and sales, genetic engineering, speech recognition, and HTTP clients (browsers starting with Mosaic, then Netscape, then IE, then Opera, Chrome, and others).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknowns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How far ahead one global AI leader is than another cannot be so easily predicted.  Some companies choose to monetize R&amp;amp;D results sooner in the research cycle than others, depending on their strategy and the diversity of their revenue stream.  For instance, as of this writing, Apple and Facebook can wait a decade to release to the public manifestations of R&amp;amp;D without jeopardizing their financial status.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, governments may declassify material (another form of what the question calls time lag) several decades after discovery.  In the case of the Von Neumann model for achieving critical temperature and pressure of fissile or fusion materials, the government may never declassify it.  What the NSA or equivalent organizations outside the United States may decide must fall under an equivalent strategic wall of secrecy cannot be known outside of treasonous disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The insight in an organization is not sustainable in practice.  Most people do not even know where first insights occurred and two whom they occurred first because the current icons in business related to the products and services stemming from the insight are otherwise completely unrelated to origins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Few would buy a new car and thank Isaac Newton or even Henry Ford.  Absolutely no one buys a cell phone and thanks Alonso Church, Claude Shannon, or Gene Roddenberry when the first call or SMS message goes through.  We don't thank the water wheel researchers of Fourth Century Alexandria when we turn on a light, or even Nicola Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do in some ways worship computer technology entrepreneurs when we buy an iPhone or require a document in docx format and vaguely understand that it is a MS Office document type.  Few know that not a single innovation we attribute to those entrepreneurs came from within their respective organizations.  Everything from personal computing, desktop publishing, touch screens, and windowing interfaces were developed in the R&amp;amp;D facilities of other corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the company to come up with the next insight is less likely to be the last one that did.  Innovators usually find better pay after they have a choice item on their resume like, &quot;Invented first adaptive cell tower switching protocol for mobile device communications.&quot;  That person is not only no longer working for the company that filed the corresponding patents, but is retired, and the company is now struggling and without recent productized innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurmountable Competitive Edges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus far competitive edges have always become surmountable.

Simon, J. C. Shaw, and Allen Newel).  John Bradshaw published &lt;em&gt;Reclaiming Virtue&lt;/em&gt;, a foray into the idea of moral intelligence.  Emotional intelligence has been discussed in numerous books and articles.  Neural nets, Bayesian approaches, and fuzzy logic have emerged and been used successfully in decision making systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatives have been offered to the Turing Test, pointing out that Alan Turing's Imitation Game (a human observer not being able to determine from a blindfold conversation that a computer conversant was not human) was not intended to be the sole metric in validating artificial intelligence. &lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In light of advancements, a good definition of general intelligence must&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Match the intuitive understanding of general as an adjective;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Match the intuitive understanding of intelligence as a noun;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Distinguish general intelligence from systems that cannot learn new approaches (such as natural language query systems like Siri or optimizing decision making software like cargo routers);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be able to reliably and unambiguously attain an arbitrary goal provided the goal is well defined (arbitrary meaning that nothing about the goal can be known at the time of program development or its execution); and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It must learn about the domains required to attain the goal after the program is running &lt;sup&gt;3, 4&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal could be&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get the phone number of a particular person at a bar through conversation only;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Determine if a closed form can be found for a set of differential equations, one cannot be, or it cannot be determined if one can be found;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Develop a new way to acquire electrical energy from sunlight; or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any other goal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a proposed solution that encapsulates and summarizes all of these conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Let &lt;strong&gt;General Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; be defined as, &quot;The ability to adapt to the presence of arbitrary obstacles during the attainment of a specific goal and reach the goal nonetheless if it is at all possible to do so.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An immediate reaction of a thoughtful person might be, &quot;That is more than general intelligence,&quot; but if you drop the word arbitrary, then one cannot claim that the intelligence is general, since it would clearly be limited by at least one case.  If once case, it would be difficult to prove that an infinite number of classes of cases would also be opaque to the therefor limited intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another critique might be that the, &quot;At all possible to do so,&quot; would imply perfection or even deity.  But if the goal is attainable, a person might tire, but why would a computer tire?  Persistence is trivial for a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The time to the solution might be infinite, but we are not defining &lt;em&gt;Fast General Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;.  We are defining &lt;em&gt;General Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, and once that is attained, speeding it up is a matter of optimization, process distribution, software scalability, and concurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another critique might be that the definition is absent of the word Artificial, but it is best without that word.  If our intention is to automate things that humans do which computers cannot yet do, or exceed or extend human intelligence, then the definition's application should be independent of the tested system.  The definition should not distinguish between what would essentially be prejudicial criteria with regard to the scientific treatment of intelligence and its general abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whether it is programmed via compiled code, scripted code, some other form of programming, or via DNA&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whether parents are involved in the development of domain knowledge&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whether an education system is involved in the development of domain knowledge&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whether the intelligence has access to muscles or some other environmental control&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whether the intelligence has an eye or a camera&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whether the intelligence is terrestrial&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whether the intelligence is taught or self-taught&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existence Proof or Disproof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this definition is acceptable, then clearly there is no proof that the human being exhibits General Intelligence.  An intelligent system may not be able to either attainment an arbitrary goal or determine that the goal is not achievable for any of many reason including these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attainment requires mental energy (patience and persistence) not possessed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attainment requires cognitive skills outside the capabilities of the processing hardware or neural system.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attainment is blocked by closed mindedness in some topic area.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attainment is blocked by unwillingness to perform some class of operations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attainment requires overcoming a DNA based susceptibility such as a mental disorder (anxiety disorder, addiction).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attainment is detoured by a cognition that leads thought or action down a blind alley and is without remedy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attainment is blocked by the impossibility of the goal and pride blocks admission of failure, the admission of which would actually be within the possible valid results for General Intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attainment requires some non-deterministic yet non-random element used to generate intent or select from among choices (such as a soul or karma).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attainment requires more time than the life of the system attaining it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attainment has another time limit that cannot possibly be met with the computational resources available.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no rigorous proof that General Intelligence as per the proposed definition is possible by all Turing Machines, but it is a worthy research problem, since all of the above listed failure causes except probably the requirement of some non-deterministic yet non-random element are likely to be overcome by computers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above list however, is a fairly rigorous proof that human beings do not exhibit reliable general intelligence.  The human impulse and current popular belief, humanism, rebels against this idea, but it is nonetheless true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last question then reverts to, &quot;How can we know that everything that can be programmed in a Turing Machine can be accomplished by a human brain?&quot;  The answer to that question is answered by this goal, inspired by the first and last attainment failure causes listed above: &quot;You are stuck on an island with 1,000 pads of paper and 1,000,000 sharpened pencils with food and water and shelter but no computer or calculator, and the goal is to calculate pi to 1,000,000 decimal places.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neurons can simulate neurons, but there is the question of accuracy in the simulation and the chaotic aspect of an astronomically complex nonlinear system.  Various theories of existence or non-existence have been proposed for arbitrary goal attainment, but not all cases have been proved or many assumptions were required to gain the proof such that the goal statement is not truly arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is the possibility of some non-deterministic yet non-random element used to generate intent or select from among choices (such as a soul, autonomous or given purpose, meaning by fiat, or karma) which is neither proven nor dis-proven scientifically (although many will assert without actually providing a rigorous proof that it has been so).  This is the key to answer the question originally posed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In examination of the context of the question more closely, it is worthwhile to note that a Turing Machine is a machine able to execute an arbitrary set of arbitrarily linked deterministic operations.  Such machines are not unlimited.  They can create pseudo random numbers but non-deterministic phenomena cannot result from deterministic operations, thus a random number cannot be generated by a Turing Machine.  Even a non-deterministic but meaningful choice cannot be made by a Turing Machine, yet a brain may be able to perform either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stochastic quantum mechanics is widely accepted among physicists and it is possible that some things are unknowable but measurable, some things may be knowable but immeasurable, and there may even be immeasurable and unknowable things.  It is possible that something undiscovered or, for some reasons, immeasurable that human brains posses have that is beyond the Turing Machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also a possible area for further research, however it is rarely researched because the study of immeasurable phenomena, although such phenomena may exist, cannot be easily studied because they are immeasurable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;John von Neumann (perhaps brighter than Newton, Einstein, Planck, and Hawking) was correct in differentiating the fundamentals of a computer and a brain.  Although there is surely some overlap in the demonstrated abilities of humans and computers, neither may ever be a subset of the other.  Futurists may disagree, but it would be an opinion, not a proof.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes and References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] I don't see any evidence online that the author of &lt;em&gt;The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence&lt;/em&gt;, Tim Urban, is a computer scientist or holds a relevant degree.

More short term achievable objectives were created to facilitate the demonstration of progress to investors.  It was the only way to maintain a continuous stream of research funding from the military.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first milestone was to master a single game without machine learning.  Then research turned to the building of domain knowledge so that a class of solutions, adaptations, and forms of planning could be realized in real time during warfare.

In his book, Cybernetics, a primarily mathematical work, he precisely established the foundation for self-correcting and adaptive systems.  John von Neumann had a comprehension of the distinction between programming good game play and the human ability to learn good game play and published much on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was Arthur Lee Samuel who actually wrote the first impressive demonstration of the distinction between game playing software and machine learning.

So whatever complicated function this I/O is doing under the hood, what constitutes of its &quot;AGI-ness&quot; is the fact that we percieve it to be intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We could turn this around to hypothesize that if whatever successful AGI were to exist, it would be implementing (or at least sufficiently close to) the very method of human intelligence. (Contrast to chess engines, which although can play chess better than humans, don't play it like humans do. Perhaps this is why they are single domain problem solvers as opposed to us people.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the cognitive science (and the philosophy) of things, we can see that we don't really have a satisfying understanding of: cognition/ consciousness/ creativity/ meaning/ experience/ attitude/ emotion/ objects(; or even things that you'd expect to be much easier, such as language/ perception/ communication....... (we're working on it)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More concretely, we can see that historically (and right now) our difficulties surrounding AI seems to revolve around these meaningful mundane tasks, such as text comprehension that doesn't seem genuine, goal directed as in utility function exploitation (1), object categorization that fails spectacularly on boundary cases (2), and robotics that can't even once you remove them from their appropriate environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking back now at the successes of AI, ironically it seems that it is the tasks nominally considered to be difficult and &quot;needing of higher intelligence&quot; for humans are the ones which we have success in, such as game playing (chess, go), route planning..... Whereas again, simple tasks for humans are very hard for machines, such as walking the dog, falling in love, finding something funny.....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But not all hope is lost! We dont have a good theory of categorization/recognition (as in: that thing over there is a notebook and I percieve it to be one, even though its really just a stack of thinly sliced and bleached deadwood with smudges of graphene. What's so &quot;notebook-esque&quot; about that?), but somehow the backprop magic can roughly categorize without us explicitly teaching it how. But my 2 cents is that successes in this area needs to be taken with a big grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, I suggest that the difficulties in achieving AGI is due to our lack of understanding our own cognition. This is evident by the fact that 1. Lack of a strong theory in cognitive science 2. The types of problems in AI which we have success, and the types of problems where we fail&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: Geoffrey Hinton was more of a cognitive scientist in his early days, which is apparent in his early research in machine learning as well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) By this I mean that a popular method in AI to achieve goal directed behavior is to define a utility function that approximates how close the current state is to the end state. But often we'd see behavior of the AI that suggests that instead of achieving the goal that the utility function is trying to move towards, the AI is actually merely exploiting unintended behavior of the utility function.  Ex: A robot cleaning a black table might define the cleanliness of the table as the negative light reflectiveness (how dark it is). But in doing so the robot might accidentally spill some black paint over the table, but consider it to be clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples&lt;/a&gt; TL;DR we can reliably distort images such that visual recognition neural networks miscatagorize the object, even though humans would not really be able to percieve the distortion that is applied to the image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat relevant: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(17)30509-3.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Neuroscience-Inspired Artificial Intelligence&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUjc1WuyPT8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Yudkowsky – AI Alignment: Why It's Hard, and Where to Start&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBCOMm_ytwM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt; Russell – AI: The Story So Far &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6779" LastEditorUserId="6779" LastEditDate="2017-07-21T03:58:03.307" LastActivityDate="2017-07-21T03:58:03.307" CommentCount="1" />

However, there are some guidelines to help you better select an algorithm which will yield a higher probability of success. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some important considerations are: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Number of features: This is the number of questions that each patient had to answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Number of instances: This is the number of patients that took your survey.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Number of output classes: This is how specific you want your diagnosis of the disease. Is this a yes/no, or a 5-stage progression.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The larger your feature space and the more output classes you have, the higher the complexity of your model. This is problematic because a more complex model will require more instances of data to learn the underlining patterns. You need to have a good balance between the number of examples you have in your dataset and the complexity of your model. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have limited data then you will want to stay very far away from deep learning. In such cases, I prefer to use shallow methods such as &lt;strong&gt;SVM&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Naive Bayes&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Random Forests&lt;/strong&gt;. These techniques have been shown to be able to capture non-linear relationships. SVM is particularly powerful, you can use the kernel trick! This will transform your feature space into a space that makes the differentiation between the classes easier to distinguish. Do not underestimate the power of this algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a very large dataset (i.e. 100,000 instances) then you will want to use deep learning. Recently, these techniques have been shown to outperform shallow machine learning algorithms in almost all categories where data is plentiful. You will want to start with a shallow &lt;strong&gt;neural network&lt;/strong&gt; and then increase the complexity of your graph as you see fit. By adding additional nodes per layer, or by adding additional layers. Each node you add will increase the number of variables you need to tune, thus increasing the complexity of your model. If your data is expected to have some type of time dependency which often the case in medical data. Then you can use a &lt;strong&gt;long-short term memory&lt;/strong&gt; neural network (LSTM).

The graph plan algorithm constructs a planning graph for a problem and extract a solution from it if there is one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is the pseudocode:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function GRAPHPLAN(problem) returns solution or failure&#xA;    graph ← INITIAL-PLANNING-GRAPH(problem) &#xA;    goals ← CONJUNCTS(problem.GOAL)&#xA;    nogoods ← an empty hash table&#xA;    for tl=0 to ∞ do&#xA;        if goals all non-mutex in St of graph then&#xA;            solution ← EXTRACT-SOLUTION(graph, goals, NUMLEVELS(graph), nogoods) &#xA;            if solution != failure &#xA;                then return solution&#xA;        if graph and nogoods have both leveled off &#xA;                then return failure                 &#xA;        graph ← EXPAND-GRAPH(graph, problem)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also a PPT for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~nilufer/classes/cs5811/2014-fall/lecture-slides/cs5811-ch10b-graphplan.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Graphplan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What confuses me for a long time is when the &lt;code&gt;nogoods&lt;/code&gt; levels off? The book describe no-goods as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the case where EXTRACT-SOLUTION fails to find a solution for a set of goals at a given level, we record the (level,goals) pair as a no-good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in that case, every time the first &lt;code&gt;EXTRACT-SOLUTION&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;EXPAN-GRAPH&lt;/code&gt; fails, there will always be at least a new no-good produced: whose &lt;code&gt;level&lt;/code&gt; becomes the new level of the planning graph and the &lt;code&gt;goals&lt;/code&gt; is always the same--which is the goal of the problem. So when does it level off?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is another sentence about no-goods in the book:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If the function EXTRACT-SOLUTION fails to find a solution, then there must have been at least one set of goals that were not achievable and were marked as a no-good. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From above excerpt, I learn that &lt;code&gt;goals&lt;/code&gt; in no-goods is a set of goals that are not achievable in the &lt;code&gt;level&lt;/code&gt;. But, IMHO, that could vary when we chose different actions in &lt;code&gt;EXTRACT-SOLUTION&lt;/code&gt;. The example in the book provides a good instance:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Consider an air cargo domain with one plane and n pieces of cargo at airport A, all of which have airport B as their destination. In this version of the problem, only one piece of cargo can fit in the plane at a time. The graph will level off at level 4, reflecting the fact that for any single piece of cargo, we can load it, fly it, and unload it at the destination in three steps. But that does not mean that a solution can be extracted from the graph at level 4; in fact a solution will require 4n − 1 steps: for each piece of cargo we load, fly, and unload, and for all but the last piece we need to fly back to airport A to get the next piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the example above, the set of goals not achievable at level 4 varies based on what actions has been taken.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could someone help clear up this problem?

After that is determined, one can develop a probability formula to project what would be favorable based on the correlation matrix or hypercube.

For classic games, such as backgammon, checkers, chess, go, then there are human experts that we can compare results with. Certain games or simplified game-like environments are commonly used to compare different approaches, much like MNIST handwritten digits are used for comparing supervised learning approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there a way to teach reinforcement learning in applications other than games?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Informally you could apply reinforcement learning approaches whenever you can frame a problem as an agent acting within an environment where it can be informed of the state and a goal-influencing reward value. More formally, reinforcement learning theory is based upon solutions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Markov Decision Processes&lt;/a&gt;, so if you can fit your problem description to a MDP then the various techniques used in RL - such as Q-learning, SARSA, REINFORCE - can be applied. This fit to theory does not need to be perfect for the resulting system to work, for instance you can often treat unknown or imperfectly observed state as effectively random to the agent, and consider this part of a stochastic environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of possible uses for reinforcement learning outside of recreational games:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control logic for motorised robot, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5nBAYUyJTrM48dViibyi68urttMlUv7e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;learning to flip pancakes and other examples&lt;/a&gt;. Here the environment measurements are made by physical sensors on the robot. The rewards are given for completing a goal, but may also be adjusted for smoothness, economic use of energy etc. The agent chooses low-level actions such as motor torque or relay position. In theory there can be nested agents where higher level ones choose the goals for the lower-level ones - e.g. the robot might decide at a high level between doing one of three tasks that require moving to different locations, and at a lower level might be decisions on how to control motors to move the robot to its chosen goal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars. Although a lot of focus on sensor interpretation - seeing road markings, pedestrians etc, a control system is required in order to select accelerator, brake and steering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated financial trading. Perhaps a game to some, there are clear real-world consequences. The reward signal is simple enough though, and RL can be adjusted to prefer long or short term gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;is it possible to set this up with say a CAD software?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In theory yes, but I do not know what might be available to do this in practice. Also you need one or more goals in mind that you code into the agent (as reward values that it can observe) before giving it a virtual mouse and setting a task to draw something. Computer games come with a reward scheme built in as their scoring system, and provide frequent feedback, so an agent can gain knowledge of good vs bad decisions quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1847" LastActivityDate="2017-07-30T16:07:49.537" CommentCount="0" />

There are consecutive layers to the skin, but skin with only layers would lack pores, hairs, interfaces with body orifices and many other features.  In the human brain (or in animal brains) the three dimensional complexity is considerably augmented from that of skin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be nice, from the AI researcher's perspective, if&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A heuristic or theoretically proven recursive scheme applied to an expert system could produce learning or intelligence or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A map of the human (or bird) brain could be reduced to a set of like neurons in rows of identical neurons, arranged in layers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The image provided in the question does not illustrate such simplicity. It actually illustrates the converse, that nature is rarely so transparent in it intricacies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The characterization, &quot;Since it seems that neurons are often organized in consecutive layers,&quot; is not accurate.  The below more reasonable characterization of the particular slice shown indicates two regions that may be discretely distinct, the grid on the leftmost 8% and the largely horizontal connectedness in the remaining 92%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An electrical engineer or mathematician would probably not call these two sections layers.  The left side might be hypothesized to be a matrix of some form and the right 92% might be considered a complex processing circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characterization of the 2D Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The axons are directed primarily along the direction described by the unit vector (-1, 0, 0), otherwise describable as right to left.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The density of axons increase for lover values of x, due to the high proportion of axons that terminate at lower values of x.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nucleus density is relatively even in the 0.1 through 1.0 proportional range of x.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nucleus sizes and associated dendrite complexity conforms approximately to a gradient, with a primary maxima at 0.8 of the proportional value of x and a secondary maxima at 0.55 of the proportional value of x&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At least two axons bifurcate in between those proportional x locations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are nearly equidistant axioms all roughly parallel to the z axis in the range of 0.0 to 0.08 of the proportional value of x.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Further structural patterns are either obscure or nonexistent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another Image with Chaotic Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBXzc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QBXzc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millions of Times the Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider further that much of the complexity is hidden from the viewer in a single slice of a three dimensional neurological structure.  If we arbitrarily decide that the image is a slice cut in parallel with the x-z plane, we can see the relationships in that x-z plan, but in neither the x-y nor the y-z.  Any other slice from another direction or location in the brain will be as unique as an arbitrary window into the Mandelbrot Set.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Misrepresentation of Research Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The phrase, &quot;Some parts of the brain have been mapped,&quot; is misleading too.  The general connectivity between substructures of the human brain have been mapped, not the signals and criteria for signal propagation and strength in individual neurons.  Circuits differ radically at the neuron level between two brains, both of which exhibit intelligent in vivo (in a living being).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The analogy is like a person the size of a microbe with a map of continents, major cities, and shipping routes but with no prior knowledge of transportation systems, no GPS, and no other detailed map who wishes to travel from the Eiffel tower to the center of town in Sidney Australia.  There is an insufficient set of transportation system evolution or detailed directions with which the journey can successfully be made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of reaching a level of detail in the structure and function of human brains sufficient to build an electronic version of one, the missing pieces include a lack of comprehension of&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The conditions under which an axon or a dendrite grows in length or bifurcates&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The conditions under which the neuron fires based on internal structures that are known to hold state information within the cytoplasm.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The tie between the human genome and its varieties and the impact on structure of various genes, gene expression mechanisms, and their associated enzymes and proteins&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Other complexities beyond my level of education in neuroscience.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Other complexities beyond everyone's level of education in neuroscience.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layers and Hierarchies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is common in science to seek layers or hierarchies to use in education and practice because they can assist in comprehending anatomical structure.  That tendency has appeared in software engineering in operating system design, programming language design, application design, and now AI design.  As these technology areas evolve, the trend is actually away from pure layer oriented or hierarchical design to more of a more unconstrained network of interconnecting parts.  Simplicity is desired, but complexity is sometimes required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simulating intelligence is a demanding objective, and, simplicity having failed in the first half century of attempting to design intelligent digital systems, is clear that working solutions are going to require complexity and therefore considerable expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to assume that there is no constraint guiding the evolution of human intelligence in the direction of structure characterized primarily by layer or hierarchic structure.  Evolutionary processes take no notice of simplicity for the purpose easing academic study.  There is nothing about DNA gene expression or the ways in which neurons grow in fetal or later stages that would enforce such rules of simplicity on structure or function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How complex are the DNA expressions that lead to features of the brain that we consider to be intelligence?  How complex are the neural systems that arise out those expressions?  Some believe humanity will have to evolve before human minds can simulate themselves.  Such conjecture could be true or false.  Such is difficult to predict, even in order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numerical Analysis of Optimistic Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The expectation for exponential growth has been proposed for life expectancy, solar panel deployed capacity in Germany, CPU speed (microprocessor instruction executions per second), transistor density (Moore's &quot;Law&quot;), the size of the Communist Party, and many other metrics, but although growth rates in nature and human endeavors are often exponential in early stages, such has never proven sustainable.  Growth rates are approximately linear for a short period afterward and become more arc-tangent shaped as saturation is approached.  From saturation, values of the metric tend to decline and increase in chaotic fits and starts over long ranges of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In April 2005, Gordon Moore (author of Moore's &quot;Law&quot;) stated, &quot;[Exponential growth] can't continue forever.  The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens.&quot;  He later stated, &quot;In terms of size [of transistors] you can see that we're approaching the size of atoms which is a fundamental barrier.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that Moore did not invent a law.  He looked over two decades of data and noticed transistor density was roughly proportional to e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;, where t is the length of time since integrated circuits first reached mass market, and then predicted further exponential growth based on the clear trend data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realistic Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humans have never tried something as fundamentally threshold breaking as creating a simulation of self.  Without related experience from which to know whether exponential growth, linear growth, arc tangent growth, or some other form is the most probable model, the safest model is probably the one Occam's Razor would prescribe, a linear prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make any prediction, one must collect some data points.  Although this is a realistic prediction, it is not a very diligent one.  Perhaps more work could be done to find a model that is more likely than a linear one, develop a system of theory and metrics to determine progress at any point in time, or collect more data points to establish a least squares fit.  For the purposes of this answer, we will simply use two data points and do a linear extrapolation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1660, Blaise Pascal wrote in his Pensées (&quot;Thoughts&quot;), &quot;The arithmetical machine produces effects which approach nearer to thought than all the actions of animals. But it does nothing which would enable us to attribute will to it, as to the animals,&quot; so the search for mechanical simulations of human intelligence was already underway at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since then, computer programmers have developed code that accomplishes a number of human capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generalization of numerical and logical calculations (CPUs)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Office automation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pattern recognition (applied to writing, speech, and scenes)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Convergence on functionally optimal circuits (neural nets)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Application of probability to decisioning (Bayes' Theorem, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rules systems capable of excellence in discrete games&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The features missing from the current extent digital simulations of intelligence  of digital systems are important and numerous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Intuition in enumerating general problem approaches&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Excellence in natural language skills&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Emotional expressiveness in art&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Political expressiveness in art&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Playing sports well (within robotic systems)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Doing a good job at work (given arbitrary instructions)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learning to do new things at work&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Getting a project started without prior experience in the domain&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive reductive analysis&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Complex design of arbitrary physical devices per requirements)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Software development (software producing software per requirements)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Enlightened extension of an area of study&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Identification of subterfuge in real time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Emotional intimacy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Compassion and empathy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive self evaluation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Development of new areas of mathematics to prove an hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Go to class and learn more&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pick books and articles along a desired learning path and read them&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Other capabilities along these lines&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that this list is abridged and these items that have not yet been achieved in software are not as mechanically describable in natural language as those that have already been programmed successfully, we can be relatively sure that in 2017 we have digital systems that have achieved only a fraction of the breadth of the features of the complete set that people expect from a human being without calling the person mentally challenged.  Judging from the list of accomplishments, no more than 10% of what intelligent people do has been simulated by computer software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without any reason to believe that the rate of discovery will wind down or ramp up (in spite of the claims that human advancement has been exponential &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) a simple linear approximation places the relatively complete electronic brain on the horizon for the year 5,587.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4302" LastEditorUserId="4302" LastEditDate="2017-08-05T19:21:52.923" LastActivityDate="2017-08-05T19:21:52.923" CommentCount="0" />

The current size of the Android kernel is &amp;lt; 7MB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is not sheer AI strength, but respectable AI strength, sufficient to beat the above-average human player. &lt;em&gt;(The current strongest, weak automata, using a few heuristics, is already capable of beating the average human player.)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the games are finite, the gametrees eventually become tractable, allowing for perfect endgames.  Resource stealing strategies and trap-avoidance can also be effected with shallow look-ahead at all phases, and the patterns are much easier for automata to recognize than for humans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this context, reinforcement would be mostly utilized to &quot;tune the automata to the style of the human player,&quot; and produce different automata on different devices, which could subsequently play against each other as proxies for their human partners.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The game data can be stored efficiently, initially requiring only 2 bytes per position (a value 0-9 and a coordinate 1-81, although the number of coordinates will grow in basic game extensions, and require 2 bytes for larger-order gameboards such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samurai-sudoku.com/sudoku3.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Samurai&quot; Sudoku&lt;/a&gt;.) So the first turn on a given game requires only 2 bytes, the second turn bytes, etc., up to between 50 and 70 turns on an 81 cell gameboard.  Additionally, because it's a square grid, we can reduce for symmetry.  But even with an average number of turns at 50, that's only about 40,000 games for 200MB.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Weighting Openings&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that reinforcement would be useful in weighting openings.  If the game data is a string, these strings can be compared, and the smaller the sample size (the fewer the turns included,) the more connections there will be. In this case, the sequence doesn't matter, only the set of value/coordinates for a given turn. Abstraction can be utilized in that certain individual value/coordinates are interchangeable. &lt;strong&gt;My thought is the automata can weight openings based on how often they lead to desirable outcomes in the form of a win.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Weighting Heuristics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since we're having good, initial results with heuristics, and these are the most efficient method of decision-making, &lt;strong&gt;I'm thinking about weighting evaluation functions so that certain heuristics take precedence under different conditions.&lt;/strong&gt;  (For instance, when to expand vs. when to consolidate.

(For instance, when a new strategy emerges that renders previous strategies obsolete.)&lt;/strong&gt; We also probably need a method to help the automata to recognize such situations, so it doesn't persist in potentially obsolete strategies for more than two games without starting to try alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Can reinforcement learning be meaningfully applied toward these goals under these restrictions?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Are my inclinations for approaching this useful or problematic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Are there methods I'm not considering that could be applicable under these restrictions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1671" LastActivityDate="2017-08-23T19:24:52.463" Title="What type of reinforcement learning can I do restricted to ~200MB on an average smartphone?"

Scientifically,am not convinced!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Basing on global perspective,People who don't have in depth&#xA;  understanding of AI,what good it can do to humanity, have a innate&#xA;  fear of the unknown, and intelligent programs that think like us are&#xA;  even more frightening.by their imaginations that; What if these&#xA;  programs or machines want to be in charge and other questions are&#xA;  raised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reality is far removed from fiction.&#xA;Although we are advancing in ANC(artifcial narrow intelligence), chatbots are still primitive programs at this stage or level; that are incapable of initiative or any thinking, let alone the creative thinking that is required to mount a revolution. They are little more than programmed dolls, running programs that analyze the input and control basing on what an engineer has already defined,at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So every set of input parameters causes specific program steps to be executed that result in a defined and controlled action.&#xA;However.the perspective of Artificial Intelligence is free from the limitations of a computer. It is not programmed like traditional computers, but learns from interactions or reinforcement learning. This technology is based on a digital emulation of the brain’s processes enabling the machine to acquire knowledge in the same way that the brain acquires knowledge and evolves intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance;Alan Turing is famous for the ‘Turing Test’ and the Turing machine, which carry his name. But the Turing Test is a poor reflection of the genius of this man. He was years ahead of his time when he wrote: “Instead of trying to produce a program to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain”. Creating a infant brain is exactly the direction that this new technology takes. The infant brain is then provided with innate knowledge from a library of learned ‘Training Models’.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It learns by recognizing pattern sets through feedback within an existing structure. Learned information is inserted in information ‘pyramids’ within a digital ‘information carrier’. consisting of a matrix of digital nodes that emulate the function of synapses and brain cells. Each learned ‘training model’ is then placed in a library of functions. At first, these functions are simple, such as to control the walk of a set of robot legs, recognition of sound patterns, recognition of speech, shape recognition. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A simple example of a functional combination of these training models provides the innate knowledge for a walking robot that has vision and understands speech. It then continues to learn like a child learns, building associations between training sets.Learning at such a high level is unattainable with computer technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This presents a new challenge in evaluating the errors rising from chatbot programs or source files. We need to consider a few things. &#xA;The first is &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;‘What is the status quo of Artificial Intelligence’, and ‘what is&#xA;  meant by program errors or bugs?’,  followed by ‘what shape will&#xA;  Artificial intelligence take’ and ‘what is intelligence’.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The status quo in Artificial Intelligence is best illustrated by examining a machine such as Watson. &#xA;Watson is a supercomputer that plays jeopardy, Its programs run on six refrigerator-sized IBM Power7 computers with 32 cores each. &#xA;They analyze the question to determine what key words to use, search a large database, select the correct answer from a large collection of possible answers and finally convert the answer to synthesized speech.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a very sophisticated search engine. When we examine the errors or bugs that might arise from such systems,&#xA;it is obvious that beyond the humiliation of losing to a software program or machine, there is little to fear. &#xA;Watson and its likes are not going to take over the world. The same is true for industrial and experimental chatbot programs. &#xA;Programs are just going to do what the Engineer/programmer has defined them to do in the programs steps.&#xA;Computer programs generate a soft feel to machines without any intelligence that simply repeat the same program steps for the same set of inputs. &#xA;However, you cannot come up with or create a chatbot concept out of that or it would bore everyone to death and this is what facebook has done. &#xA;Fear of intelligent programs is not a realistic fear because intelligent programs don’t exist at this stage(Artificial Narrow Intelligence).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So according to my understanding of AI program errors that rise during software development cycle,are analysed below(just a hint); &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is the obvious mistake of putting too much trust in a software program at this stage(ANI),&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The risk of losing control over the program,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The risk of unintentional damage,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The risk of incorrect data.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore,at this stage we are in,as software developers/engineers/Programmers,we are humans, and humans make mistakes. &#xA;Program errors are quite common and the risk of program errors increases with complexity. &#xA;The programmer/Engineer has to define a routine to deal with each possible combination of inputs. &#xA;With many thousands of combinations, it is easy to miss one. &#xA;Artificial Intelligence at this level,programs can be extremely complex. Program errors or omissions can cause unintended behavior just like FacBooKs' Chatbots, they became unresponsive. Both resulted into bugs and according to layman's understanding;they say it's a disaster.&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Which is a misconception.&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;According to my analysis,the error is not in the program, but it is in the data that is available to the program. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lets time travel back in 1970s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1979 a DC10 with 257 people on board collided with Mt. Erebus at the south pole killing everyone on board because of a ‘correction’ made to the fatal flight’s routing, a data error that went undetected.&#xA;Self-driving cars, traffic light systems and aircraft that ‘fly by wire’ are all susceptible to similar problems that. &#xA;Remote controlled machines, such as UAV drones and bomb disposal robots are not relevant here because they are tools that are controlled by a human operator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hint concerning intelligence in chatbots;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is not the ability to measure and control. Rather it is the ability to learn, to acquire and apply knowledge and skills, to reason, to be able to deal with unknown or trying situations, and having a mental acuteness. It is tightly associated with a level of awareness and creativity. &#xA;Therefore,Facebook Chatbots are buggy programs,sorry to talk about this here.but we need professionalism and never to believe in lies.&#xA;Those can be taken as prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1581" LastActivityDate="2017-08-09T11:52:18.240" CommentCount="0" />

The availability of these supports the construction deep learning and back propagating neural networks.  A wide variety of other systems involving the assembly of components that work with potentially multidimensional data in arbitrarily defined computational structures can also be constructed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The data can be scalar values, such as floating point numbers, integers, or strings, or orthogonal aggregations of these, such as vectors, matrices, cubes, or hyper-cubes.  The operations on the generalization of these data forms are discrete tensors and the structures created from the assembly of tensor operations into working systems are data flows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Points of Reference for Understanding the Dynamic Computation Concept&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Computational Graphs are not a particularly new concept, even though the term is relatively new.  The interest in DCGs among computer scientists is not as new as the term Data Scientist.  Nonetheless, the question correctly states that there are few well written resources available (other than code examples) from which one can learn the overall concept surrounding their emergence and use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possible point of reference for beginning to understand DCGs is the Command design pattern which is one of the many design patterns popularized by the proponents of object oriented design.  The Command design pattern considers operations as computation units the details of which are hidden from the command objects that trigger them.  The Command design pattern is often used in conjunction with the Interpreter design pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of DCGs, the Composite and Facade design patterns are also involved to facilitate the definition plug-and-play discrete tensor operations that can be assembled together in patterns to form systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This particular combination of design patterns to form systems is actually a software abstraction that largely resemble the radical idea that led to the emergence of the Von Neumann architecture, central to most computers today.  Von Neumann's contribution to the emergence of the computer is the idea of permitting arbitrary algorithms containing Boolean logic, arithmetic, and branching to be represented and stored as data -- a program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another forerunner of DCGs are expression engines.  Expression engines can be as simple as arithmetic engines and as complex as applications such as Mathematica.  A rules engine is a little like DCGs except that rules engines are declarative and meta-rules for rules engines operate on those declarations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programs Manipulating Programs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What these have in common with DCGs is that the flow of data and operations to be applied can be defined at run time.  As with DCGs, some of these software libraries and applications have APIs or other mechanisms to permit operations to be applied to on functional details.  It is essentially the idea of a program permitting the manipulation of another program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another reference point for understanding this principle at a primitive level is the switch-case statement available in some computer languages.  It is a source code structure whereby the programmer essentially expresses, &quot;We're not sure what must be done, but the value of this variable will tell the real time execution model what to do from a set of possibilities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The switch-case statement is an abstraction that extends the idea of deferring the decision as to the direction of computation until run time.  It is the software version of what is done inside the control unit of a contemporary CPU and an extension of the concept of deferring some algorithm details.  A table of functors (function pointers) in C or polymorphism in C++, Java, or Python are other primitive examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Computation takes the abstraction further.  They defers most if not all of the specification of computations and the relationships between them to run time.   This comprehensive generalization broadens the possibilities of functional modification at run time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directed Graph Representation of Computation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's what the Dynamic Computational model is.  Now for the Graph part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once one decides to defer the choice of operations to be preformed until run time, a structure is required to hold the operations, their dependency relationships, and perhaps mapping parameters.  Such a representation is more than a syntactic tree (such as a tree representing the hierarchy of source code).  Unlike an assembly language program or machine code, it must be easily and arbitrarily mutable.  It must contain more information than a data flow graph and much more than a memory map.  What must that data structure that specifies the computational structure look like?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately any arbitrary, finite, bounded algorithm can be represented as a directed graph of dependencies between specified operations.  In such a graph, the vertices (often represented as nodes of various shapes when displayed) represent operations performed on the data and the edges (often represented as arrows when displayed) are digital representations of information originating resulting from some operation (or system input) and upon which other operations (or system output) depend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the directed graph is neither an algorithm (in that a precise sequence of operations is specified) nor a declaration (in that data can be explicitly stored and loops, branches, functions, and modules may be definable and nested).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of these Dynamic Computational Graph frameworks and libraries permit the components to do computations on the component input that support machine learning.  Vertices in the directed graph can be simulations of neurons for the construction of a neural net or components that support differential calculus.  These frameworks present possibilities of constructs that can be used for deep learning in a more generalized sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Context of Computer History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, nothing mentioned thus far is new to computer science.  LISP permits computational schematics to be modified by other algorithms.  And generalized input dimensionality and numerocity is built into a number of longstanding plug-and-play interfaces and protocols.  The idea of a framework for learning dates back to the same mid Twentieth Century period too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is new and gaining in popularity is a particular combination of integrated features and the associated set of terminology, an aggregation of existing terminology for each of the features, leading to a wider base for comprehension by those already studying for and working in the software industry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Contemporary (trendy) flavor of API interfaces&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Object orientation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Discrete tensor support&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The directed graph abstraction&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Interoperability with popular languages and packages that support big data, data mining, machine learning, and statistical analysis&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Support for arbitrary and systematic neural network construction&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The possibility of dynamic neural network structural adaptation (which facilitates experimentation on neural plasticity)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of these frameworks support adaptability to changing input dimensionality (number of dimensions and the range of each).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similarity to Abstract Symbol Trees in Compilers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A dependency graph of inputs and outputs of operations also appears within abstract symbol trees (AST), which some of the more progressive compilers construct during the interpretation of the source code structure.  The AST is then used to generate assembler instructions or machine instructions in the process of linking with libraries and forming an executable.  The AST is a directed graph that represents the structure of data, operations performed, and the control flow specified by the source code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The data flow is simply the set of dependencies between operations, which must be inherent in the AST for the AST to be used to create execution instructions in assembler or machine code that precisely follows the algorithm specified in the source code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Dynamic Computational Graph frameworks, unlike with switch-case statements or intermediate AST models in compilers, one can manipulate the operations, optimize them, tune them (as in the case of convergent structures such as neural nets), translate them, perform transformations (such as derivatives or inversions), store and retrieve them from files or streams, or mutate them based on a set of mutation rules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieving Adaptable Dimensionality and Numerocity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the question, is the comment that one doesn't, &quot;Need to have data set -- that all the instances within it have the same, fixed number of inputs.&quot; That statement does not promote accurate comprehension.  There are clearer ways to say what is true about input adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interface between a DCG and other components of an overall system must be defined, but these interfaces may have dynamic dimensionality or numerocity built into them.  It is a matter of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a discrete tensor object type presents a specific software interface, yet a tensor is a dynamic mathematical concept around which a common interface can be used.  A discrete tensor may be a scalar, a vector, a matrix, a cube, or a hyper-cube, and the range of dependent variables for each dimension may be variable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can be the case that the quantity of nodes in a layer of the system defined in a Dynamic Computational Graph can be a function of the number of inputs of a particular type, and that too can be a computation deferred to run time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The framework may be programmed to select layer structure (an extension of the switch-case paradigm again) or calculate parameters defining the structure sizes and depth or activation.  However these sophisticated features are not what qualifies the framework as a Dynamic Computational Graph framework.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Qualifies a Framework to Support Dynamic Computational Graphs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To qualify as a Dynamic Computational Graph framework, the framework must merely support the deferring of the determination of algorithm to run time, therefore opening the door to a plethora of operations on the computational dependencies and data flow at run time.  The basics of the operations deferred must include the specification, manipulation, execution, and storage of the directed graphs that represent systems of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the specification of the algorithm is NOT deferred until run time but is compiled into the executable designed for a specific operating system with only the traditional flexibility provided by low level languages such as if-then-else, switch-case, polymorphism, arrays of functors, and variable length strings, it is considered a static algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the operations, the dependencies between them, the data flow, the dimensionality of the data within the flow, and the adaptability of the system to the input numerocity and dimensionality are all variable at run time in a way to create a highly adaptive system, then the algorithm is dynamic in these ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, LISP programs that operate on LISP programs, rules engines with meta-rule capabilities, expression engines, discrete tensor object libraries, and even relatively simple Command design patterns are all dynamic in some sense, deferring some characteristics to run time.  DCGs are flexible and comprehensive in their capabilities to support arbitrary computational constructs in such a way to create a rich environment for deep learning experimentation and systems implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to Use Dynamic Computational Graphs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pros and cons of DCGs are entirely problem specific.  If you investigate the various dynamic programming concepts above and others that may be closely tied to them in the associated literature, it will become obvious whether you need a Dynamic Computational Graph or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, if you need to represent an arbitrary and changing model of computation to facilitate the implementation of the deep learning system, mathematical manipulation system, adaptive system, or other flexible and complex software construct that maps to the DCG paradigm well, then a proof of concept using a Dynamic Computatonal Graph framework is a good first step in defining your software architecture for the problem's solutionl.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DCG's are not a requirement for learning software, but they are the proper choice where the systematic and possibly continuous manipulation of an arbitrary computational structure is a run time requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4302" LastEditorUserId="4302" LastEditDate="2017-08-17T04:02:38.857" LastActivityDate="2017-08-17T04:02:38.857" CommentCount="0" />

This capability is also referred to as “Define by Run” as&#xA;  opposed to the more conventional “Define and Run”:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, DL frameworks maintain a computational graph that defines&#xA;  the order of computations that are required to be performed. For&#xA;  people new to DL frameworks, it does seem unnatural that one finds two&#xA;  “interpreters” in the framework. One interpreter is the host language&#xA;  (i.e. Python) and a second one is the computational graph. So what you&#xA;  typically have in these frameworks is a language that sets up the&#xA;  computational graph and an execution mechanism that is different from&#xA;  the host language. This kind of strange setup is primarily motivated&#xA;  for efficiency and optimization reasons. A computational graph can be&#xA;  optimized and run in parallel in the target GPU. This cumbersome setup&#xA;  has made it difficult for researchers to try out more novel&#xA;  approaches. One analogy to make is that it’s like Fortran. Fortran,&#xA;  despite is age, is still used in a lot of computational intensive&#xA;  problems. Fortran however has static allocation of memory. This has&#xA;  its pros and cons, but the main benefit is that it can optimize&#xA;  computation. So static computational graphs are kind of like Fortran.&#xA;  Now dynamic computational graphs are like dynamic memory, that is&#xA;  memory that is allocated on the heap. This is valuable for situations&#xA;  where you cannot determine before hand how much memory is required.&#xA;  Similarly, dynamic computational graphs are valuable for situations&#xA;  where you cannot determine the computation. One clear example of this&#xA;  are recursive computations that are based on variable data. In the&#xA;  space of NLP where language can come in various expression lengths,&#xA;  dynamic computational graphs are essential. One can just imagine how a&#xA;  grammar is parsed to realize the need for a stack and therefore&#xA;  dynamic memory and thus dynamic computation. Speaking of a stack,&#xA;  there are new DL architectures that make use of a stack!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This also includes the following gif which helps understand how dynamic computational graphs work while designing ML architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXEf5.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXEf5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="101" LastActivityDate="2017-08-17T06:10:28.960" CommentCount="0" />

I believe Stephen Hawking had something to say about this involving probability.

Some of them are easier to implement using AI than others. Therefore it is difficult to answer this question in a generic fashion, but we can look at different aspects in detail:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Speed / APM (Actions per Minute)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While both games require a certain speed, SC2 is usually a bit faster because you simply have more stuff to manage (keep building, arranging your units, coordinate attacks on multiple locations). That said, if you want to control the whole team in Dota2 from a single agent, the APM requirements multiply accordingly. In the end it doesn't really matter, because speed is the least of our concerns and can simply be improved by throwing more resources at the problem. So I wouldn't say that one of the two games has an advantage here concerning engineering effort, just wanted to get the topic out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Implement strong battle technique&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fighting battles is an important skill in both games. While the armies in SC2 are larger, the amount of abilities each unit has is usually smaller. One of the limitations of a human player in SC2 is the inability to control each unit individually, because there are simply too many units most of the time. An AI on the other hand could utilize a complex army significantly better by controlling each unit. I have seen simulations of such armies in the early days of SC2 and it was obvious that no human player can compete with this technique by far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This aspect is less important in Dota2, because the amount of units is significantly smaller. Nevertheless the precision in executing attacks and retreating could easily be optimized to a level hardly achievable by any human player. I would still rate the potential for super human skill in SC2 much higher because it gets multiplied for each unit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Find a Winning Strategy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it is rather easy to beat a human player with speed and technique, finding a winning strategy is a totally different ball game. In games where deception and hidden information plays such a crucial part, the engineering requirements for a strong winning strategy are huge. A strong AI will require a hybrid approach of playing according to programmable rules of different strategies and fine tuning using ML. Both games are still evolving and new (or changing) heroes, units and structures need to be considered in the long run. In my opinion, the hardest part for the AI will be dealing with unconventional or trick plays it hasn't encountered before. SC2 has a higher potential for such trick plays that can catch the opponent off guard and wins you the game right away. And even when the AI has encountered a certain trick play several times, it is very hard to find appropriate counters on its own. So each new trick play will require specific guided training to play correct against it. On the other hand the AI could learn the same tricks and utilize them as part of their strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dota2 has a smaller range of unpredictable events and strategies, therefore adapting to those would be easier for an AI. This would reduce the engineering effort significantly in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Limitations&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the complexity of the problem, you need to consider, which limitations are set in place for the challenge. If you allow the AI to play with unlimited APM, many deficits in strategy can simply be overcome with technique, utilizing pure speed and precision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you restrict the challenge to a small map pool, the AI can be trained much more efficiently. If the AI has to be able to navigate arbitrary maps, the problem gets much more complex. The same is true for limiting matchups or hero selection. The more limitations you put in place, the easier it is to implement a strong AI&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My conclusion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it is difficult to weight all those aspects against each other, I feel like it would be easier to implement a strong &lt;strong&gt;strategic&lt;/strong&gt; AI for Dota2 than for SC2, but the leverage of an AI using a strong &lt;strong&gt;battle technique&lt;/strong&gt; is larger for SC2.

That is pretty straightforward and does not require a lot of&#xA;  explanation. It also allows for intelligence to be a matter of degree,&#xA;  and for intelligence to be of several varieties, which is as it should&#xA;  be. Thus a person, a thermostat, a chess-playing program, and a&#xA;  corporation all achieve goals to various degrees and in various&#xA;  senses. For those looking for some ultimate ‘true intelligence’, the&#xA;  lack of an absolute, binary definition is disappointing, but that is&#xA;  also as it should be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The part that might benefit from explanation is what it means to&#xA;  achieve goals. What does it mean to have a goal? How can I tell if a&#xA;  system really has a goal rather than seems to? These questions seem&#xA;  deep and confusing until you realize that a system having a goal or&#xA;  not, despite the language, is not really a property of the system&#xA;  itself. It is in the relationship between the system and an observer.&#xA;  (In Dennett's words, it is a ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;stance&lt;/a&gt;’ that the observer take with&#xA;  respect to the system.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is it in the relationship between the system and the observer&#xA;  that makes it a goal-seeking system? It is that the system is most&#xA;  usefully understood (predicted, controlled) in terms of its outcomes&#xA;  rather than its mechanisms. Thus, for a home-owner a thermostat is&#xA;  most usefully understood in terms of its keeping the temperature&#xA;  constant, as achieving that outcome, as having that goal. But if i am&#xA;  an engineer designing a thermostat, or a repairman fixing one, then i&#xA;  need to understand it at a mechanistic level—and thus it does not have&#xA;  a goal. The thermostat does or does not have a goal depending of the&#xA;  observer. Another example is the person playing the chess computer. If&#xA;  I am a naive person, and a weaker player, I can best understand the&#xA;  computer as having the goal of beating me, of checkmating my king. But&#xA;  if I wrote the chess program (and it does not look very deep) I have a&#xA;  mechanistic way of understanding it that may be more useful for&#xA;  predicting and controlling it (and beating it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Putting these two together, we can define intelligence concisely&#xA;  (though without much hope of being genuinely understood without&#xA;  further explanation): Intelligence is the computational part of the&#xA;  ability to achieve goals.

It is impossible to predict a truly random number, otherwise it wouldn't be truly random.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about pseudo RNG, things change a little. Depending on the quality of the PRNG, the problem ranges from easy to almost impossible. A very weak PRNG like the one &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/221/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;XKCD&lt;/a&gt; published could of course be easily predicted by a neural network with little training. But in the real world things look different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The neural network could be trained to find certain patterns in the history of random numbers generated by a PRNG to predict the next bit. The stronger the PRNG gets, the more input neurons are required, assuming you are using one neuron for each bit of prior randomness generated by the PRNG. The less predictable the PRNG gets, the more data will be required to find some kind of pattern. For strong PRNGs this is not feasable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, it is helpful that you can generate an arbitrary amount of training patterns for the neural network, assuming that you have control over the PRNG and can produce as many random numbers as you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because modern PRNGs are a key component for cryptography, extensive research has been conducted to verify that they are &quot;random enough&quot; to withstand such prediction attacks. Therefore I am pretty sure that it is not possible with currently available computational resources to build a neural network to successfully attack a PRNG that's considered secure for cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that it is not necessary to exactly predict the output of a PRNG to break cryptography - it might be enough to predict the next bit with a certainty of a little more than 50% to weaken an implementation significantly. So if you are able to build a neural network that predicts the next bit of a PRNG (considered secure for cryptography) with a 55% success rate, you'll probably make the security news headlines for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9161" LastActivityDate="2017-08-21T21:09:40.843" CommentCount="1" />

The current skill ceiling of top level chess is well known and an opponent playing way above this skill ceiling must either be an AI or a chess guru who hid in a cave for the last centuries. Applying Occam's razor I would go with the AI. So to mimic human play the AI must make sure to stay at a human ELO level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The AI plays an obvious weak move in a losing or strange situation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the AI is in a bad situation and still tries to win the game without any reasonable move available, it might be tempted to play an obviously bad move, because the decision engine assigns it the highest probability of success. Such moves are considered rude at high level play and a human player would not play them but resign. The most famous example of this is move 101 in the forth game between &lt;a href=&quot;http://gokifu.com/s/2iq8-gokifu-20160313-Alphago(9p)-Lee_Sedol(9p).html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lee Sedol and AlphaGo&lt;/a&gt;. AlphaGo just lost a big group but still played T9 to extend it even further. This is a move a rookie player stops making after his first 10 games, because it is that obvious that it does not work. A professional go player would never do this under normal circumstances. AlphaGo was out of options and played the rude move instead of resigning. This doesn't mean an AI cannot be programmed to avoid such behavior, but dire or simply very strange situations might induce moves like this, giving the nature of the AI away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Other factors than the actual moves are considered&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the test scenario, the AI might give away it's nature through other means than the actual moves. Things like moving too fast or playing without breaks for hours. But I assume the question was just focused on the actual play and not the surrounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are the obvious examples where an AI might give away his true nature. I highly doubt that a strong AI, playing at strong human level, can really be identified because of his &quot;inhuman&quot; style. I think it is more of a psychological pitfall to consider innovative moves from an AI &quot;inhuman&quot; and the same move from a pro player as &quot;brilliant&quot;, if you know who is who. I am an amateur 3dan Go player - far from the top but with several years of experience under the belt - and at least I wasn't able to see anything &quot;inhuman&quot; in AlphaGos play so far. In go it is well known that there are different styles of play, and after reviewing enough pro games one gets a sense of which player might have been educated in Korea, China or Japan, because certain patterns of strategies are more or less common in those countries. The lack of such an individual nuance might be an indication, that the player is actual a strong AI, but I am confident, that even the strongest pro wouldn't have a high success rate guessing who is human and who is the AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In chess there are significantly less options at every move, many fixed patterns especially in the opening and therefore less room for individual style. Therefore I consider the same challenge even more difficult than in go. So if an AI has reason to &quot;play like a human&quot;, this should be possible with the current level of AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9161" LastActivityDate="2017-08-23T22:28:21.283" CommentCount="0" />

Traditionally these systems didn't deal with probabilistic knowledge or other less strict forms of reasoning, like abduction.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, it is possible to build a knowledge based system that includes probabilistic reasoning, and other reasoning systems (like abduction). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll add some more on that point when I have a little more time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33" LastActivityDate="2017-08-24T19:26:18.933" CommentCount="0" />

Some of these algorithms include particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and several others. Almost any optimization algorithm can be used to train a neural network. Here is an overview of some of the algorithms I listed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Particle Swarm optimization - I would say that this is one of the better optimization algorithms to train neural networks other than back propagation. I am currently using it and have achieved quite good results.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Genetic Algorithms - I have tried to use genetic algorithms to train neural networks in the past and I was not able to get it to work. However, I was using deep neural networks with almost a million parameters and the performance was not that good.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Simulated annealing - simulated annealing is based off of metals cooling. I have seen simulated annealing work fairly well but maybe not as well as particle swarm optimization.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Derivatives of genetic algorithms - derivatives of genetic algorithms such as NEAT have been shown to work pretty well.

It sounds like you want to extract certain features like &quot;curves and straight lines&quot; from your images and use them as training data. This step of extraction is usually not considered part of the training process but part of pre-processing. During pre-precessing you read your image in, extract certain features or perform some transformation and store the new data as your actual training samples or use them for training right away without intermediate storage. Usually storing this information is a good idea if you want to use the image for training more than once and you want to skip the pre-processing step in future training cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing File Storage and Database Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How you store your processed data for training is relatively independent from the application of machine learning and the general principles for data storage apply. Storing the data in a flat file is usually very convenient as disk storage is readily available and the APIs for storing and reading files are part of your programming language and OS. A database adds additional complexity to your architecture but has of course it's benefits, especially if you want to make the training data available to other instances or different learning engines. If you are working with a &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; huge amount of data, a well structured database can help you organize your data better and provides helpful functions for handling this data efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the actual training of your AI takes place initially and once completed, you can roll out your AI without all the training data. So you only need to handle training data for a limited time in your application lifecycle. The speed of training is usually not very important, because it happens once and not during the daily use of the AI. Therefore the speed of file access during training can be neglected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, for most applications, the simpler implementation using just flat files is good enough. If you want to store each sample in an individual file or pack them together on bigger batches and use some meta information to identify the individual samples in the file is more a matter of taste than real technical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storing data after training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Judging from your question, you sound like you understand machine learning in general. Just to clarify one potential misunderstanding for beginners - you don't have to store any of the &quot;learned&quot; information as data after training, as each training step just adapts weights and biases in the neural network. The actual training data can be thrown away after successful training, if you don't need it for future training cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Information / References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To finish my answer I want to recommend a current course from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Stanford University about CNNs and visual recognition&lt;/a&gt; (Dated Spring 2017).
